Balderjahn I.; Hoffmann S.; Hüttel A.	BHH_2023	How empowerment and materialism contribute to anti-consumers’ well-being	2023	Survey	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: Because steadily growing consumption is not beneficial for nature and climate and is not the same as increasing well-being, an anti-consumerism movement has formed worldwide. The renouncement of dispensable consumption will, however, only establish itself as a significant lifestyle if consumers do not perceive reduced consumption as a personal sacrifice. Since prior research has not yielded a consistent understanding of the relationship between anti-consumption and personal well-being, this paper aims to examine three factors about which theory implies that they may moderate this relationship: decision-control empowerment, market-control empowerment and the value of materialism. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on data from a large-scale, representative online survey (N = 1,398). Structural equation modelling with latent interaction effects is used to test how three moderators (decision-control empowerment, market-control empowerment and materialism) affect the relationship amongst four types of anti-consumption (e.g. voluntary simplicity) and three different well-being states (e.g. subjective well-being). Findings: While both dimensions of empowerment almost always directly promote consumer well-being, significant moderation effects are present in only a few but meaningful cases. Although the materialism value tends to reduce consumers’ well-being, it improves the well-being effect of two anti-consumption styles. Research limitations/implications: Using only one sample from a wealthy country is a limitation of the study. Researchers should replicate the findings in different nations and cultures. Practical implications: Consumer affairs practitioners and commercial marketing for sustainably produced, high-quality and long-lasting goods can benefit greatly from these findings. Social implications: This paper shows that sustainable marketing campaigns can more easily motivate consumers to voluntarily reduce their consumption for the benefit of society and the environment if a high level of market-control empowerment can be communicated to them. Originality/value: This study provides differentiated new insights into the roles of consumer empowerment, i.e. both decision-control empowerment and market-control empowerment, and the value of materialism to frame specific relationships between different anti-consumption types and various well-being states. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.	10.1108/EJM-04-2020-0284	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146227395&doi=10.1108%2fEJM-04-2020-0284&partnerID=40&md5=cd5eddfc29635eec68abd87d03aa4994
Bullard O.; Manchanda R.V.	BM_2013	Do sustainable products make us prevention focused?	2013	Experiments	Yes	Marketing Letters	In recent years, increasing attention is evident with regard to the depletion of natural resources, the development of "green" products and services and the sustainability practices of organisations. Building on Regulatory Focus theory (Higgins, Organ Behav Hum Decis Processes 69(2):117-132, 1997), we examine the difference between a promotion focus for marketing products and services (which emphasises attainment, achievement and advancement) and a prevention focus (which emphasises protection, security and responsibility). The results of three empirical studies show that (1) perceived sustainability practices of a company activate a prevention focus in consumers, (2) consumers make prevention-focused inferences about the products of a sustainable company, and (3) sustainable products are perceived to be better positioned if they are marketed with prevention-framed (vs. promotion-framed) appeals. This suggests that companies with sustainability-oriented practices and product offerings will be more effective if they use prevention-focused appeals in their marketing efforts. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.	10.1007/s11002-012-9221-2	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876427350&doi=10.1007%2fs11002-012-9221-2&partnerID=40&md5=d3e903df9b16cbafb08207c36efb01ae

BPJNM_2024	Gamification as an innovation: a tool to improve organizational marketing performance and sustainability of international firms	2024	Field Survey	Yes	International Marketing Review	Purpose: This study aims to investigate an under-researched area, an international marketing perspective, based on international dynamic capability, environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance in gamification and non-gamification-based organizational culture (OC). This paper deepens the understanding of gamification-based and non-gamification-based OC influence on innovation capability and environmental and organizational marketing performance through the theory of organizational creativity and the theory of administrative behavior (AB). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data from firms that abide by the ISO 14091 certifications to ensure the proper quality standards. Primary data from 384 firms are used to test the hypotheses. The results would help firms invest in technological solutions by practicing creativity over time. Additionally, the study helps explore how AB is critical in steering technological creativity for making firms climate-conscious. Findings: The study's findings identified that OC has a positive influence on technological innovation capabilities and environmental innovation capabilities. Technological innovation capabilities have a beneficial impact on environmental sustainability. Environmental sustainability appears to have a substantial correlation with technological innovation skills. Environmental innovation capabilities positively impact environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance. A moderating effect of gamification on the international dynamic capabilities within a relationship between organizational culture and environmental innovation capabilities exists. Originality/value: The investigation is confined to understanding how gamification-based and non-gamification-based organizational marketing culture affects innovation capability, environmental sustainability and organizational performance through the lens of theory of organizational creativity and theory of AB. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.	10.1108/IMR-05-2022-0113	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150646066&doi=10.1108%2fIMR-05-2022-0113&partnerID=40&md5=81630cfc95cdabb02a20ae92c58e9924

BSK_2016	An Exploration and Investigation of Edible Insect Consumption: The Impacts of Image and Description on Risk Perceptions and Purchase Intent	2016	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	As a result of the dramatic increase in global population, food waste, and unsustainable practices, the United Nations urges the promotion of edible insects as an alternative food source. However, edible insects are perceived as an unappealing, disgusting food source despite the nutritional and sustainable advantages, especially among Westerners. Therefore, research is needed to bridge the gap between the call for examining alternative food sources and the marketing initiatives to improve purchasing behavior. This research draws upon information processing and risk perception theories to investigate reducing consumers' negative perceptions toward edible insect food products. The first study examines the effect of image and description in a retail setting while the second study examines a restaurant setting. Results find that in retail settings image was the most significant in reducing perceptions of risk while in the restaurant setting menu description was most important. In addition, vague descriptions were more preferable to explicit descriptions in minimizing risk and increasing purchase intention. Finally, the research provides meaningful implications for the marketers who endeavor to promote alternative food products as well as any products that involve negative and unfamiliar perceptions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	10.1002/mar.20847	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954145747&doi=10.1002%2fmar.20847&partnerID=40&md5=9239a06c8deca98884a079781af36d4e
Brough A.R.; Wilkie J.E.B.; Ma J.; Isaac M.S.; Gal D.	BWMIG_2016	The green-feminine stereotype and its effect on sustainable consumption	2016	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Consumer Research	Why are men less likely than women to embrace environmentally friendly products and behaviors? Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this green-feminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, gender identity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors. © 2016.

Chernev A.; Blair S.	CB_2021	When Sustainability is Not a Liability: The Halo Effect of Marketplace Morality	2021	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Consumer Psychology	Prior research has suggested that consumers believe that products made using sustainable, environmentally friendly technologies are likely to underperform those made using traditional methods. We question the robustness of this assumption and identify scenarios in which sustainability is likely to have the opposite effect, strengthening rather than weakening consumers' product performance beliefs. Specifically, we argue that sustainability is likely to produce a halo effect able to attenuate and even override the negative impact of compensatory inferences underlying consumers' belief that sustainability comes at the expense of performance. We propose that this halo effect stems from consumers' view of the company as a moral agent engaged in a prosocial behavior. In this context, we identify two factors that are likely to influence the strength of the halo effect: the degree to which consumers view the company as a moral agent whose actions aim to benefit society and the degree to which moral concerns are prominent in consumers' minds. Following this line of reasoning, we identify two ways in which managers can increase the perceived performance of sustainable products: by associating sustainable benefits with the company rather than with its products and by emphasizing the societal benefits of sustainability. We test these predictions in a series of four empirical studies that show convergent evidence for our theorizing. Our findings have important public policy implications, documenting actionable strategies that managers can use to mitigate the potential negative impact of sustainability and strengthen the perceived performance of sustainable products. © 2020 Society for Consumer Psychology	10.1002/jcpy.1195	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092490083&doi=10.1002%2fjcpy.1195&partnerID=40&md5=63f8095f411ea67b5d16379e3fa0045e
Chernev A.; Blair S.; Böckenholt U.; Mishra H.	CBBM_2024	Is Sustainability a Liability? Green Marketing and Consumer Beliefs About Eco-Friendly Products	2024	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of Public Policy and Marketing	Prior research has suggested that consumers believe sustainable products tend to underperform compared with those made using traditional methods, a phenomenon referred to as the “sustainability liability.” Despite early conceptual justification and evidence supporting this argument, recent research has not attempted to validate this effect and assess its practical relevance. By employing a variety of scenarios adapted from prior studies, the authors quantify the magnitude of the sustainability-liability effect and show that it is relatively small and unlikely to be meaningful. This research also estimates the boundary conditions to identify scenarios in which a significant sustainability-liability effect might occur. Using archival data, the authors demonstrate that the association between sustainability and inferior product performance has decreased over time, explaining the discrepancy between their findings and prior research. These findings have important public policy implications, providing decision makers with empirical evidence that designing and promoting eco-friendly products can benefit society without detracting from the perceived performance of the company's offerings. © American Marketing Association 2024.	10.1177/07439156241264286	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199670987&doi=10.1177%2f07439156241264286&partnerID=40&md5=7d40a4391cc4a5c1632a8692a4b30c8f

CCFSC_2023	Implications of dynamic capabilities on triple bottom line performance after the COVID-19 pandemic: An empirical insight from B2B marketing perspective	2023	Field Survey	Yes	Industrial Marketing Management	Triple bottom line (TBL) is a concept of business which highlights that firms should not measure their business success based only on their financial performance, but they should also measure their social and environmental impacts. In other words, the concept of triple bottom line also includes people, planet, and profit. Also, dynamic capabilities help a firm to address rapid environmental changes, and studies have shown that they can improve a firm's sustainability performance. Other studies have shown that TBL initiatives can also improve a firm's sustainability performance. But no studies have investigated how dynamic abilities as well as TBL initiatives could simultaneously impact sustainability performance of B2B firms in the post COVID-19 period. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the implications of dynamic capabilities on TBL performance after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially from the B2B marketing perspective. Drawing on dynamic capability view (DCV), TBL theory and the extant literature, a conceptual research model was developed which was subsequently validated with the PLS-SEM technique using 377 responses from different manufacturing and service-oriented firms. This is the first study to extensively analyze the combined impacts of these two dimensions on firms' sustainability performance, and thus it has enriched the literature related to DCV, TBL, and sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.	10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.10.005	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173429147&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2023.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=ce3955b385b8641cf81a97ce3f57d5a5

CGLZ_2019	Media Coverage of Climate Change and Sustainable Product Consumption: Evidence from the Hybrid Vehicle Market	2019	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of Marketing Research	As sustainable consumption becomes increasingly important, firms must better understand the drivers behind the consumption of these products. This article examines the effects of mass media in the context of the U.S. hybrid vehicle market. Drawing on monthly sales data, the authors provide evidence that the general coverage of climate change or global warming by major media outlets exerts an overall positive impact on the sales of hybrid vehicles. This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase. They provide implications for theory and practice and call for future research that examines the causal impact of media in general on consumer decisions, especially in domains that are crucial for the society. © American Marketing Association 2019.	10.1177/0022243719865898	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078605800&doi=10.1177%2f0022243719865898&partnerID=40&md5=64756c262a35811f6de9047ae20a7051
Chen W.-F.; Liu J.	CL_2023	When less is more: Understanding consumers' responses to minimalist appeals	2023	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Minimalism, which encourages people to live with fewer possessions, is an emerging theme in marketing communication that often appeals to the sustainable ideal of reducing consumption and waste (e.g., Patagonia's “Buy less” campaign). However, consumers' responses to this marketing approach remain under-researched. We investigate whether consumers' responses to minimalist appeals depend on their socioeconomic status. We find that consumers with lower socioeconomic status report less favorable evaluations of brands that adopt minimalist appeals, because these consumers tend to prefer quantity over quality in daily consumption—a preference that is incongruent with minimalism. This effect is moderated by the considerations of product-usage frequency: even consumers with low socioeconomic status can become more favorable toward minimalist brands if the benefit of minimalism, namely the increased usage of each product, is salient. © 2023 The Authors.

CP_2014	Understanding the underutilization of urban bicycle commuting: A behavioral reasoning perspective	2014	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of Public Policy and Marketing	In an effort to make urban transportation more sustainable, policy makers and social marketers have turned increased attention to bicycling. The authors apply behavioral reasoning theory to investigate consumers' mental processing of bicycle commuting to better understand why such an active mode of transportation is underutilized in many urban areas. Using a large-scale sample of commuters in Dublin, Ireland, the study offers insights into the psychological antecedents of bicycling adoption. The structural equation modeling results confirm the main premise of behavioral reasoning theory, in that reasons serve as important linkages between people's values and their attitudes and behavior. In particular, the findings suggest that commuters have reasons not to engage in bicycling (e.g., inconvenience, perceived danger), which account for most of the variance in bicycle-commuting behavior. The findings challenge interventions that emphasize the role of information campaigns and one-time infrastructural changes in encouraging voluntary change in travel behavior. Instead, the findings suggest that transportation planners and social marketers would be better off addressing consumers' reasons for and against bicycling through community-based initiatives. © 2014, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jppm.13.087	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919399410&doi=10.1509%2fjppm.13.087&partnerID=40&md5=6e820c2bd520e65b6d7d8fb37b9ac670
Cornelissen G.; Pandelaere M.; Warlop L.; Dewitte S.	CPWD_2008	Positive cueing: Promoting sustainable consumer behavior by cueing common environmental behaviors as environmental	2008	Experiments	Yes	International Journal of Research in Marketing	People frequently fail to see themselves as environmentally conscious consumers; one reason for this is that they are oftentimes prone to dismissing their more common ecological behaviors (e.g., avoid littering) as non-diagnostic for that particular self-image. The cueing of commonly performed ecological behaviors as environmentally friendly (what we call positive cueing) renders both cued and non-cued common ecological behaviors more diagnostic for the inference of pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1). As a result, positive cueing increases the likelihood that people will see themselves as consumers who are concerned with the degree to which their behavior is environmentally responsible (Study 2). The cueing of common ecological behaviors leads participants to choose environmentally friendly products with greater frequency, and even to use scrap paper more efficiently (Study 3). We discuss the implications for effective social marketing campaigns. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This research explores values, beliefs about the importance of SCP, and buying behaviors of supermarket customers from within a stake-holder framework. Beliefs about the importance of SCP (both social and environmental, but not economic) were found to be related to values. Also, it was found that customers' environmentally responsible buying behaviors were related to their beliefs about the importance of environmental SCP. However their socially responsible buying was not related to their beliefs about the importance of social SCP. Responsible buying behavior may be facilitated by providing reliable information about environmental and social aspects of products.

Casidy R.; Yan L.	CY_2022	The effects of supplier B2B sustainability positioning on buyer performance: The role of trust	2022	Field Survey	Yes	Industrial Marketing Management	Sustainability positioning is essential for firms that operate in highly competitive environments, as businesses are increasingly being evaluated in terms of their sustainable practices. Drawing upon social exchange theory, this study examines the role of trust as an underlying mechanism through which supplier B2B sustainability positioning influences buyer performance. A survey of 389 Australian B2B executives reveals the critical role of relational and competency trust in mediating the relationship between B2B sustainability positioning and buyer performance. However, industry-relevant factors such as transactional uncertainty and competitive intensity influence the mediating effects of trust in opposite directions. Specifically, competency trust has stronger mediating effects on buyer performance when there is lower transactional uncertainty and greater competitiveness. On the other hand, relational trust has stronger mediating effects on buyer performance when there is greater transactional uncertainty. The findings provide useful insights for firms wishing to leverage their sustainable image in order to appeal to prospective buyers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.	10.1016/j.indmarman.2022.02.005	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124471321&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2022.02.005&partnerID=40&md5=3157b5a65341735cc4eb3f90d295fe0d
Dixon D.; Mikolon S.	DM_2021	Cents of self: How and when self-signals influence consumer value derived from choices of green products	2021	Experiments	Yes	International Journal of Research in Marketing	Consumers choosing between green and conventional products often believe such choices imply trade-off decisions, such that green products provide morally-related advantages but embody price or quality-related disadvantages compared to standard products. We study the consequences of such trade-offs for consumer value in the context of privately consumed green products. To develop our theoretical model, we draw from the perspective of self-signaling – consumers' act of signaling information about their internal qualities to their own self through choice. We explore how and when self-signals from such trade-off decisions influence consumer value gained from comparative choices of green versus standard products. Six studies were conducted, using divergent measures of the dependent variable, multiple product categories, and measured as well as manipulated self-concept clarity (SCC). We find a joint effect of self-signals from comparative choices and self-concept clarity on consumer value, such that positive self-signals lead to incrementally higher satisfaction and willingness to pay for consumers with low SCC but not significantly so for those with high SCC. Results show that this joint effect may occur for consumers with low SCC because they gain incremental value from perceived self-concept alignment – a state that is construed from the perception that a self-signal is aligned with the consumer's self-concept. This study contributes to marketing research by proposing and testing a novel mechanism that can underlie self-signaling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.	10.1016/j.ijresmar.2020.08.002	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092238597&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijresmar.2020.08.002&partnerID=40&md5=165532ed8bfb401dfba17b5fa636d18b
Friske W.; Hoelscher S.A.; Nikolov A.N.	FHN_2023	The impact of voluntary sustainability reporting on firm value: Insights from signaling theory	2023	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science	The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between voluntary sustainability reporting and firm value, as measured by Tobin’s q. We test three main hypotheses developed from signaling theory and the sustainability reporting literature on a large panel of reporting and non-reporting organizations for the period 2011–2020. The results of a fixed effects panel model suggest that, in general, sustainability reporting is negatively related to Tobin’s q. However, the results also indicate that the relationship between sustainability reporting and Tobin’s q becomes increasingly positive over time. Our conclusion is that sustainability reporting is initially a costly signal, but that it eventually enhances firm value as companies learn how to better communicate sustainability initiatives to stakeholders and investors learn how to properly evaluate reports. Finally, in an analysis of sustainability reporting organizations, we find that external assurance is positively associated with Tobin’s q. External audits appear to increase the credibility of reports. Implications for marketing theory and practice are discussed. © 2022, Academy of Marketing Science.	10.1007/s11747-022-00879-2	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132112389&doi=10.1007%2fs11747-022-00879-2&partnerID=40&md5=f95a8f56558c5718ee07e67db347ecd9
Garvey A.M.; Bolton L.E.	GB_2017	Eco-product choice cuts both ways: How proenvironmental licensing versus reinforcement is contingent on environmental consciousness	2017	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Public Policy and Marketing	This research identifies how choice of an eco-product (e.g., low-energy LED light bulbs, biodegradable paper towels) influences downstream, environmentally responsible behavior. Eco-product choice either reinforces or undermines subsequent environmentally responsible behavior, and this effect is contingent on individual consumers' preexisting environmental consciousness: among less environmentally conscious consumers, proenvironmental behavior is undermined; in contrast, highly environmentally conscious consumers display reinforcement of proenvironmental behavior. The authors reveal that these differential effects are driven by two discrete processes working in opposition: goal satiation drives licensing in the case of less environmentally conscious consumers, and prosocial self-perceptions drive reinforcement among highly conscious consumers. In addition, the authors identify a point-of-purchase intervention that mitigates the detrimental effects among less environmentally conscious consumers. Together, these results shed light on the downstream consequences of eco-product choice for consumers, with implications for the marketing and regulation of such products. © 2017, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jppm.16.096	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038836809&doi=10.1509%2fjppm.16.096&partnerID=40&md5=ff3554731eedd267ef2cbbd31dd4ec2a

GCCH_2016	Adjusting the warm-glow thermostat: How incentivizing participation in voluntary green programs moderates their impact on service satisfaction	2016	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Marketing	In Study 1, the authors find that people are more satisfied with a service experience when they choose to participate in the provider's voluntary green program (e.g., recycling)-an effect mediated by the "warm glow" of participation. The downside, however, is that this same mechanism decreases satisfaction among people who choose not to participate. In Study 2, analysis of data from the J.D. PowerGuest Satisfaction Index suggests that incentivizing the program (i.e., compensating the program participants) paradoxically increases satisfaction for those who do not participate but decreases satisfaction among those who do. Studies 3 and 4 explore how manipulating incentive characteristics might enable managers to maximize satisfaction for both groups. Study 3 indicates that, compared with no incentive, an "other-benefiting" incentive increases warm glow and satisfaction for green program participants but decreases them among nonparticipants. Study 4, however, suggests that mixed incentive bundles (i.e., providing both self-benefiting and other-benefiting options)maximize warm glow and satisfaction for both groups-the ideal outcome for managers. © 2016, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jm.14.0497	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978036844&doi=10.1509%2fjm.14.0497&partnerID=40&md5=e73a18511ccae69b10c7c93881b8545d
van Herpen E.; van Nierop E.; Sloot L.	HNS_2012	The relationship between in-store marketing and observed sales for organic versus fair trade products	2012	Field Survey	Yes	Marketing Letters	To stimulate sales of sustainable products, such as organic and fair trade products, retailers need to know whether their in-store instruments effectively enhance market shares. This study uses sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to explain the market shares of sustainable products according to shelf layout factors, price level, price promotions, and consumer demographics. It argues that the effect of these variables differs between organic versus fair trade products, as buying motives might differ, organic buyers tend to be more loyal, and price is a more informative signal of quality for organic products. Results show that the number of facings has a positive relationship with the market share of fair trade brands, but not with the market share of organic brands. The same holds for the price difference with the leading brand, which is important for fair trade brands but not for organic brands. In contrast, an arrangement of the product category by brand is associated with higher market share for organic brands but not for fair trade brands. Additionally, placement at eye level and clustering of items benefits both types of sustainable brands, whereas they appear to be not very sensitive to price promotions. Finally, higher sales of sustainable products are found in areas where the customer base is older and has a higher education level. © 2011 The Author(s).	10.1007/s11002-011-9154-1	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857632884&doi=10.1007%2fs11002-011-9154-1&partnerID=40&md5=6d18e810880c431303caebfab3d4e889
Harries T.; Rettie R.; Studley M.; Burchell K.; Chambers S.	HRSBC_2013	Is social norms marketing effective?: A case study in domestic electricity consumption	2013	Natural Experiment	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present details of a large-scale experiment that evaluated the impact of communicating two types of feedback to householders regarding their domestic electricity consumption: feedback on their own consumption and feedback of both their own consumption and that of others in their locality. Design/methodology/approach: Digital technologies were used to automatically measure and communicate the electricity consumption of 316 UK residents for a period of 16 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: one involving no feedback; one involving feedback about a household's own usage, and one involving a household's own usage plus social norms feedback (the average consumption of others in the locality). At the end of the study, a selection of participants took part in interviews or focus groups. Findings: Both types of feedback (individual and individual-plus-social-norms) led to reductions in consumption of about 3 per cent. Those receiving social norms feedback were significantly more likely to engage with the information provided. However, the social norms information had no additional impact on consumption. Survey and interview data confirmed that participants from both conditions had been encouraged to adopt new energy-saving practices. The study concludes that near real-time individual feedback can be sufficient for usage reduction if it is provided in a historical format. It also suggests that the impact of social norms information may previously have been confounded with that of individual feedback. Originality/value: This is the first time that a controlled experiment in the field of domestic electricity consumption has compared the impact of real-time social norm information with that of information that only contains individual household usage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.	10.1108/EJM-10-2011-0568	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883681030&doi=10.1108%2fEJM-10-2011-0568&partnerID=40&md5=dc7ea11202d1c667674d6e77f25fc7a2
Hinsch C.; Tang Y.; Lund D.J.	HTL_2021	Compulsion and reactance: Why do some green consumers fail to follow through with planned environmental behaviors?	2021	Survey	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Some green consumers fail to follow through with planned environmental behaviors (EB), despite claiming intent to do so. The current research draws on reactance theory to shed light on this paradox at the intersection of environmentalism, sustainability, and green marketing. Historically, individuals have been conceptualized dichotomously as either pro or antienvironmental. Mann questions this simplistic perspective and introduces the “Wizard” and “Prophet” as environmentalist archetypes. Wizards and Prophets both engage in EB, but Wizards perceive science and technology as potential solutions, whereas Prophets believe consumption reduction is the only answer. Building upon self-discrepancy theory and using both qualitative and quantitative data, we find support for Mann's thesis that both environmentalist archetypes exist, and both have inclinations toward EB. Furthermore, these archetypes differ in how they respond to marketing messages or other external stimuli. Whereas Prophets are stimulated and increase EB when compelled to, Wizards react negatively resulting in decreased environmental behavior. Psychological reactance moderates the mediated effect of compulsion by magnifying the effect of this path. We propose that higher levels of reactance increase the positive impact of compulsion on Prophets while amplifying the negative effect of compulsion for Wizards. Exposing Wizards to marketing communications compelling environmentalism suppresses their EB. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	10.1002/mar.21570	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112062835&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21570&partnerID=40&md5=46bb70328b866b27a65578d76d5abca8

HWN_2014	Seeing the world through GREEN-tinted glasses: Green consumption values and responses to environmentally friendly products	2014	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Consumer Psychology	The primary goal of this research is to conceptualize and develop a scale of green consumption values, which we define as the tendency to express the value of environmental protection through one's purchases and consumption behaviors. Across six studies, we demonstrate that the six-item measure we develop (i.e., the GREEN scale) can be used to capture green consumption values in a reliable, valid, and parsimonious manner. We further theorize and empirically demonstrate that green consumption values are part of a larger nomological network associated with conservation of not just environmental resources but also personal financial and physical resources. Finally, we demonstrate that the GREEN scale predicts consumer preference for environmentally friendly products. In doing so, we demonstrate that stronger green consumption values increase preference for environmentally friendly products through more favorable evaluations of the non-environmental attributes of these products. These results have important implications for consumer responses to the growing number of environmentally friendly products. © 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.	10.1016/j.jcps.2013.11.002	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903216367&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcps.2013.11.002&partnerID=40&md5=23e3c866eec52161f0879008d729a4b9
Jain S.; Basu S.; Dwivedi Y.K.	JBD_2024	Green brand identity and B2B channel partners' tactical green marketing orientation: Moderating effect of brand governance	2024	Mixed Methods	Yes	Industrial Marketing Management	Even though environmental values and sustainable branding have garnered much attention in the B2C context, B2B contexts remain relatively less explored. This study introduces a novel synthesis of Signaling theory and Stewardship theory and examines the moderating impact of brand governance on the relationship between green brand identity, consistent communication and channel partner commitment, leading to tactical green marketing orientation. Distinguishing itself from previous research, our approach embraces a multi-perspective lens, delving into the viewpoints of both channel partners and organizations (i.e., managers). Employing an explanatory sequential mixed method design, the first phase involved an empirical survey with 248 respondents (Study 1). Subsequently, the second phase (Study 2) comprised qualitative interviews with 41 respondents. The findings from both studies converged, revealing a positive association between “consistent communication” and “attitude,” a robust connection between “attitude” and “commitment,” and a favorable correlation between “green brand identity” and “attitude,” ultimately leading to a positive relationship between “attitude” and “green tactical marketing orientation". This research significantly contributes to the comprehension of B2B green brand positioning by demonstrating, that in the B2B context, brand governance influences channel partners' commitment and tactical green marketing orientation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.	10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.04.013	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192064548&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2024.04.013&partnerID=40&md5=89d481f6efe8678a46b4515549a879d4

JPCGZ_2024	Interactive effects of organizational resources on sustainable product design practices: a resource orchestration perspective	2024	Field Survey	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the interactive effects of a firm’s strategic sustainability orientation (SSO) and customer relationship capital (CRC) on sustainable product design practices (SPDP). Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the interactive effects of two firm resources, namely, SSO and CRC, as they relate to SPDP, using survey data from 132 manufacturers in Malaysia. Findings: The findings show that the effect of SSO on SPDP is stronger when CRC is low, than otherwise. The authors also find that the interactive effects of the firm-level resources stated above are stronger when customer pressures (CPs) are higher than when they are low. Research limitations/implications: The authors contribute to the literature by studying the effects of firm-level strategic resources and their interactions as they relate to SPDP. An important limitation of this research is the usage of single-source data and single-period data. Practical implications: Managerially, this research provides new insights into how organizations should respond to CPs while understanding the counterintuitive but disabling effects of customer relationship assets. Social implications: The findings are important to society because most of the environmental impact arising from the production, consumption and disposal of products is a direct consequence of decisions made at the product design stage and an unintended consequence of the marketing decision-making processes that underlie marketing strategy formulation that fails to recognize ecosystems impact as a standard decision influence. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to study the effects of firm-level strategic resources and their interactions as they relate to SPDP. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.	10.1108/EJM-04-2022-0253	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85178908958&doi=10.1108%2fEJM-04-2022-0253&partnerID=40&md5=2cdc89925aaff355fe87b524ebd1458a
Karmarkar U.R.; Bollinger B.	KB_2014	BYOB: How bringing your own shopping bags leads to treating yourself and the environment	2015	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of Marketing	As concerns about pollution and climate change become more mainstream, the belief that shopping with reusable grocery bags is an important environmental and socially conscious choice has gained prevalence. In parallel, firms have joined policy makers in using a variety of initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. However, little is known about how these initiatives might alter other elements of consumers' in-store behavior. Using scanner panel data from a single California location of a major grocery chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that bringing one's own bags increases purchases of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also indulgent foods. They use experimental methods to further explore the expression of these effects and to consider the effects of potential moderators, including competing goals and store policies. The findings have implications for decisions related to product pricing, placement and assortment, store layout, and the choice of strategies employed to increase the use of reusable bags. © 2015, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jm.13.0228	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937554414&doi=10.1509%2fjm.13.0228&partnerID=40&md5=66877ee277b6c773c1faf4d399d2533d
Kapoor P.S.; Balaji M.S.; Jiang Y.	KBJ_2023	Greenfluencers as agents of social change: the effectiveness of sponsored messages in driving sustainable consumption	2023	Experiments	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: This study aims to examine the role of message appeals (concrete vs abstract) posted by greenfluencers in determining their behavioral intention toward the sponsored sustainable product. This study examined the underlying mechanism of message authenticity and product sustainability image in this relationship. This study also investigated the boundary condition of product type (utilitarian vs hedonic) in the effect of sustainability message appeal on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Four studies were carried out. One field experiment on Facebook and three scenario-based online experiments were conducted to test the proposed relationships. Findings: This study found that a concrete message appeal results in a higher purchase intention of the promoted product than an abstract message appeal. This effect is a result of message authenticity and product sustainability image. Furthermore, product type moderates the impact of message appeal on behavioral intention via message authenticity and product sustainability image. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the literature on influencer marketing, sustainability communication and the persuasion process. Practical implications: This study’s findings provide insights for greenfluencers and firms that leverage greenfluencers to promote their sustainable products on social media. Specifically, it lays out how the sustainability message should be framed to be persuasive.

Kumar V.; Jones E.; Venkatesan R.; Leone R.P.	KJVL_2011	Is market orientation a source of sustainable competitive advantage or simply the cost of competing?	2011	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of Marketing	The authors use panel data constructed from the responses of repeatedly surveyed top managers at 261 companies regarding their firm's market orientation, along with objective performance measures, to investigate the influence of market orientation on performance for a nine-year period from 1997 to 2005. The authors measure market orientation in 1997, 2001, and 2005 and estimate it in the interval between these measurement periods. The analyses indicate that market orientation has a positive effect on business performance in both the short and the long run. However, the sustained advantage in business performance from having a market orientation is greater for the firms that are early to develop a market orientation. These firms also gain more in sales and profit than firms that are late in developing a market orientation. Firms that adopt a market orientation may also realize additional benefit in the form of a lift in sales and profit due to a carryover effect. Market orientation should have a more pronounced effect on a firm's profit than sales because a market orientation focuses efforts on customer retention rather than on acquisition. Environmental turbulence and competitive intensity moderate the main effect of market orientation on business performance, but the moderating effects are greater in the 1990s than in the 2000s. © 2011, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jmkg.75.1.16	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952329478&doi=10.1509%2fjmkg.75.1.16&partnerID=40&md5=5be92872e1053348b7f83de735dd586a
König S.; Maier E.	KM_2024	The effect of green influencer message characteristics: Framing, construal, and timing	2024	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	This research explores the characteristics of green influencer messages on follower engagement by examining the interplay between message framing (gain vs. loss), construal level (high vs. low), and post timing (weekdays vs. weekends). Green influencers (also: greenfluencers or sustainable influencers) are considered a key agent for a change to more sustainable consumption. A pilot field study of 1000 green influencers, however, indicates that the current communication practices of green influencers (which strongly focus on gain frames, low construal, and posts during the week) are not ideal for maximizing engagement and sustainable behavioral intentions. Two experiments replicate this finding and establish the process through which green influencer posts affect engagement: gain frames increase fluency, which increases engagement; low construal levels decrease psychological distance, which increases engagement. Timing moderates these processes in that weekend posts increase the engagement with gain frames and week posts increase the engagement with low-construal frames. These findings highlight that there is no silver bullet in green influencer messages, but that green influencers need to adapt the framing and construal of their messages to the posts' timing to increase their contribution to more sustainable lifestyles and the greater good. © 2024 The Authors.

Liang J.; Guo L.	LG_2021	Gratitude and sustainable consumer behavior: A moderated mediation model of time discounting and connectedness to the future self	2021	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Previous studies have explored the relationship between positive emotions and individuals’ sustainable consumer behavior, but the results are inconsistent. Emotions with the same valence but different cognitive appraisals may have different effects on such behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effects of specific positive emotions on sustainable consumer behavior. Using a longitudinal survey and three experimental studies, this study tests the effect of gratitude on sustainable product choice and examines the underlying psychological mechanism. The results indicate that both trait and state gratitude increase individuals’ sustainable product choice. Furthermore, time discounting mediates the relationship between gratitude and sustainable product choice. Connectedness to the future self moderates the mediation process in the path from gratitude to sustainable product choice and in that from gratitude to time discounting. The findings enrich our understanding of the relationship between gratitude and sustainable product choice and provide marketers with tools to increase consumers’ sustainable product choice by incorporating a gratitude appeal into their marketing communications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	10.1002/mar.21502	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106212200&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21502&partnerID=40&md5=ebbdeee89121bcb55d5fdee82ad0601c

LGZ_2024	Investigating the disruptiveness of the sharing economy at the individual consumer level: How consumer reflexivity drives re-engagement in sharing	2024	Experiments	Yes	Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science	The sharing economy represents an emerging technology-enabled socioeconomic system. Given its disruptive nature, the sharing economy not only challenges traditional marketing theories but also alters consumer norms and beliefs related to consumption concepts. Whether, when, and how the sharing economy transforms consumption remain important questions for managers to investigate. This study examines how sharing experiences influence consumers’ critical self-reflection and shape their intentions to re-engage in sharing practices. With data collected from two surveys and four experiments (including three pretests and one main study), we show that consumers’ perceived economic utility, social value, and sustainability potential in the sharing economy influence their intentions to re-engage in sharing practices, thus forming a loyal customer base. In addition, consumer reflexivity mediates this effect. We also show that past experience with business-to-consumer sharing practices moderates the proposed mediating effect. Overall, we demonstrate the disruptive impact of the sharing economy on individual consumers with meaningful managerial implications and contributions to marketing theories. © 2023, Academy of Marketing Science.	10.1007/s11747-023-00926-6	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149728639&doi=10.1007%2fs11747-023-00926-6&partnerID=40&md5=1af4be3341a604dd44e3338a97539535

LKM_2013	"Greening" the marketing mix: Do firms do it and does it pay off?	2013	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science	Growing concern about the sustainability of the natural environment is rapidly transforming the competitive landscape and forcing companies to explore the costs and benefits of "greening" their marketing mix. We develop and test a theoretical model that predicts (1) the role of green marketing programs in influencing firm performance, (2) the impact of slack resources and top management risk aversion on the deployment of such programs, and (3) the conditioning effects that underpin these relationships. Our analyses show that green marketing programs are being implemented by firms, and we find evidence of significant performance payoffs. Specifically the results indicate that green product and distribution programs positively affect firms' product-market performance, while green pricing and promotion practices are directly positively related to firms' return on assets. In addition, industry-level environmental reputation moderates the links between green marketing program components and firms' product-market and financial performance. Finally, we find that slack resources and top management risk aversion are independently conducive to the adoption of green marketing programs-but operate as substitutes for each other. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.	10.1007/s11747-012-0317-2	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874148541&doi=10.1007%2fs11747-012-0317-2&partnerID=40&md5=e97b0b4e9c897f9f17ffffb77d7e337b
Luchs M.G.; Naylor R.W.; Irwin J.R.; Raghunathan R.	LNIR_2010	The sustainability liability: Potential negative effects of ethicality on product preference	2010	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Marketing	Manufacturers are increasingly producing and promoting sustainable products (i.e., products that have a positive social and/or environmental impact). However, relatively little is known about how product sustainability affects consumers' preferences. The authors propose that sustainability may not always be an asset, even if most consumers care about social and environmental issues. The degree to which sustainability enhances preference depends on the type of benefit consumers most value for the product category in question. In this research, the authors demonstrate that consumers associate higher product ethicality with gentleness-related attributes and lower product ethicality with strength-related attributes. As a consequence of these associations, the positive effect of product sustainability on consumer preferences is reduced when strength-related attributes are valued, sometimes even resulting in preferences for less sustainable product alternatives (i.e., the "sustainability liability"). Conversely, when gentleness-related attributes are valued, sustainability enhances preference. In addition, the authors show that the potential negative impact of sustainability on product preferences can be attenuated using explicit cues about product strength. © 2010, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jmkg.74.5.18	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77956708677&doi=10.1509%2fjmkg.74.5.18&partnerID=40&md5=d16d359c33d96c4546e6514d72f6b37d

MFMS_2024	My money—My problem: How fear-of-missing-out appeals can hinder sustainable investment decisions	2024	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Cryptocurrencies (cryptos) have detrimental environmental effects due to their massive energy consumption. While several green crypto coins have been launched, the mainstream—environmentally unfriendly coins—still lead the market. In this study, we explore if influencer marketing, specifically fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) appeals, can contribute to promoting green crypto coin purchases to encourage sustainable investments. The results of five studies (two lab experiments using neurobiological sensors, two online experiments, and a discrete choice experiment) show that social media postings conveying FOMO appeals decrease (increase) green crypto (normal crypto) coin investments. The results further show that message congruence and emotional value perceptions mediate this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed results hold when adding governance and regulatory crypto support as well as the crypto price path evolution to the choice. The results provide notable theoretical contributions and implications for policymakers concerned with fostering more sustainable consumption behavior in the crypto context. © 2024 The Author(s).

MHFT_2013	Regulatory fit effects for injunctive versus descriptive social norms: Evidence from the promotion of sustainable products	2013	Experiments	Yes	Marketing Letters	Consumers face marketing messages using social norms in many situations where different goals are dominant. This research examines moderating effects of regulatory focus for descriptive and injunctive norms in the promotion of sustainable products. More specifically, it shows that descriptive norms have a better fit with a promotion than prevention focus, while this is not the case for injunctive norms. Three experiments examine consequences for perceived message fluency, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Experiment 1 investigates regulatory focus when induced before a normative message, whereas Experiments 2 and 3 investigate regulatory elements ingrained in the message itself. Results show that messages with descriptive norms are perceived as more fluent and have a stronger impact on attitudes and intentions when promotion goals are salient than when prevention goals are salient. Unlike descriptive norms, injunctive norms are not affected by regulatory focus. Marketers using descriptive norms should develop message wording and context accordingly. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.	10.1007/s11002-013-9234-5	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876439448&doi=10.1007%2fs11002-013-9234-5&partnerID=40&md5=47087baea14b3bf01d7ccf9b13e9324d
Muncy J.A.; Iyer R.	MI_2020	The impact of the implicit theories of social optimism and social pessimism on macro attitudes towards consumption	2020	Survey	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	People have substantially differing attitudes towards consumption. Anti-consumers are negative towards consumption. In contrast, pro-consumers view consumption in a positive light. We posit that people's attitudes toward consumption at the societal (macro) level are impacted by the implicit theories they hold about whether society can solve the problems it faces. We identify two different implicit theories consumers hold regarding how solvable larger societal problems are. Social optimists believe that we will solve the problems that are emerging as we evolve at the societal level. In contrast, social pessimists believe that societal evolution is creating problems too large to be solved. We developed a macro attitudes model where social optimism and pessimism were posited to impact people's macro attitudes towards consumption. We present the results of a study that found that social optimists have more positive attitudes towards consumption and social pessimists have more negative attitudes towards consumption. We also found that this model provided a superior fit in comparison to three other plausible models relating implicit theories and attitudes towards consumption. These findings have implications for anti-consumption research, consumer research on implicit theories, and social marketing designed to address problems associated with overconsumption. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	10.1002/mar.21304	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075740098&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21304&partnerID=40&md5=143db67697ad7674018605b33e14e05b

This study, which includes respondents from the United States, Germany, and South Korea (total n = 1,018) who completed an online survey about usage of Facebook and Twitter, examines motives for sustainable behaviors. Kelman's (1958) functional motives, which correspond to the three major philosophies of psychology, were used as the theoretical foundation for this study. For all countries, involvement motives lead to recycling behaviors and green transportation use, but only for the United States and Germany do involvement motives lead to antimaterialistic views and organic food purchase. Collectivist South Korea has the highest level of social media involvement and of sustainable behaviors except in recycling, where Germany leads. Motives are complex, demanding careful analysis from advertisers who plan to deliver green advertisements over social media. © 2013 American Academy of Advertising.	10.1080/00913367.2012.10672458	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876725932&doi=10.1080%2f00913367.2012.10672458&partnerID=40&md5=3380f35e335648f75287ac37f71b3bd0

MMRI_2021	“Game on!” Pushing consumer buttons to change sustainable behavior: a gamification field study	2021	Field Survey	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: Marketers have begun to investigate the potential of gamification for influencing consumer behavior by using game design elements in realms varying from branding, retail, sales and health services. Marketers have also begun to explore consumer behavior in sustainability. This paper aims to provide contributions to build on both literatures. Design/methodology/approach: This research tests gamification principles in a large field study on real consumers that includes data from pre-post surveys, gamified app analytics and household energy meters. The data are analyzed using ANOVA’s and structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings demonstrate: gamification significantly enhanced consumers’ knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions and realized bill savings compared to a control group; reward-based game design elements including points, badges and other rewards contribute to enhancing sustainable behavior outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Future research in settings outside of sustainability may extend upon the findings of the current research to further understanding the impact of reward-based game design elements in marketing. Practical implications: The findings have important practical implications for how organizations might use serious games to promote sustainable and other desirable behavior. In particular, how reward-based game design elements, points, trophies and badges, can be used to create a chain of relationships that leads to reduced electricity consumption. Originality/value: This paper fulfills the need to understand if the impact of gamification extends outside of controlled environments and into the field.

O_2013	It's not easy being green: The effects of attribute tradeoffs on green product preference and choice	2013	Experiments	Yes	Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science	Despite widespread pro-green attitudes, consumers frequently purchase non-green alternatives. One possible explanation for this value-action gap is the tradeoffs that green products often force on their users: higher prices, lower quality, and/or reduced performance. The current study uses conjoint analysis to uncover the attribute preferences of car and TV buyers when green attributes are negatively correlated with conventional attributes. These attribute preferences are then used to predict choice among sets of green and less green alternatives currently sold in the marketplace. Strong preferences for green products are found when tradeoffs are not apparent, but preference shifts significantly to less green compromise alternatives when the actual attribute tradeoffs are considered. Although general preference is reduced by tradeoffs, a green product offering some compensatory advantage on a conventional attribute does attract a broader spectrum of consumers, while only "dark green" consumers are willing to pay the price to go green when the product offers few compensatory qualities. In all cases, however, predicted buyers of the greenest technologies offset some of their environmental benefits by choosing more energy-thirsty specifications on negatively correlated conventional attributes. Managerial and public policy implications of the findings are then discussed. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.	10.1007/s11747-012-0305-6	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874190075&doi=10.1007%2fs11747-012-0305-6&partnerID=40&md5=6878b035a17154cc19343935e0244558
Oh H.; Bae J.; Currim I.S.; Lim J.; Zhang Y.	OBCLZ_2016	Marketing spending, firm visibility, and asymmetric stock returns of corporate social responsibility strengths and concerns	2016	Field Survey	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	PurposeThis paper aims to focus on the unique goal of understanding how marketing spending, a proxy for firm visibility, moderates the effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) strengths and concerns on stock returns in the short and long terms. In contrast to the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, the visibility theory, based on stakeholder awareness and expectations, offers asymmetric predictions on the moderation effects of marketing spending. Design/methodology/approachThe predictions are tested based on data from KLD, Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices from 2001-2010 and panel data based regression models. FindingsTwo results support the predictions of the visibility theory over those of the RBV. First, strengths are associated with higher stock returns, for low marketing spending firms, and only in the long term. Second, concerns are associated with lower stock returns, for high marketing spending firms, also only in the long term. A profiling analysis indicates that high marketing spending firms have high R&D spending and are more likely to operate in business-to-customer than business-to-business industries. Practical implicationsThe two findings highlight the importance of coordination among chief marketing, sustainability and finance officers investing in CSR and marketing for stock returns, contingent on the firm’s marketing and R&D spending and industry characteristics. Originality/valueThis paper identifies conditions under which CSR is and is not related to stock returns, by uniquely considering three variables omitted in most past studies: marketing spending, CSR strengths and concerns and short- and long-term stock returns, all in the same study. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.	10.1108/EJM-05-2015-0290	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977100893&doi=10.1108%2fEJM-05-2015-0290&partnerID=40&md5=4a6f9d5d0518aa140acee44438471e30

PDRBA_2023	I might try it: Marketing actions to reduce consumer disgust toward insect-based food	2023	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Retailing	Despite the potential health- and sustainability-related benefits of insect-based food products, many consumers do not perceive them as an alternative to conventional foods. This research provides a systematic approach to explain consumer reactions to insect-based food products conducting a series of multi-method studies involving implicit, self-reported, and actual behavioral responses to real insect-based food products (provided by a partner company). The authors investigate how product type (i.e., whether the insect-based food is utilitarian or hedonic in nature) and packaging characteristics (i.e., whether the image of a real or stylized insect is present on the front packaging or not) interact with consumer-related characteristics (i.e., health consciousness and food neophobia) to affect feelings of disgust, which in turn influence willingness to try insect-based food products. A distinctive feature of this research is that a partner company used the findings to change its marketing tactics and observed an improvement in its market performance. Our research has clear implications for marketing managers trying to overcome consumer resistance to eating insect-based foods, as well as retail managers considering marketing such food products. © 2022 New York University	10.1016/j.jretai.2022.12.003	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146061676&doi=10.1016%2fj.jretai.2022.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=9c47656620d162a983bc6e3d9135fc29

The authors examine the affective states associated with different stages of consumer change related to wasteful repetitive consumption behavior (i.e., disposable plastic bottled water consumption). With two empirical studies, the authors identify guilt, hope, pride, and optimism as relevant triggers of increased intent to manage personal consumption in pursuit of a desirable social outcome (i.e., reduction of disposable plastic bottled water consumption). While guilt, hope, and pride are relevant self-referential emotions to initial stages of change (Study 1), optimism is a principal construct in motivating people to adopt and maintain the behavior over time (Study 2).

Pichierri M.; Pino G.	PP_2023	Less saturated, more eco-friendly: Color saturation and consumer perception of product sustainability	2023	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Color saturation—the color's purity and intensity (also known as vividness)—is a visual feature that has been under-investigated in the context of green marketing. To advance knowledge of this topic, we performed five experimental studies to confirm that consumers tend to unconsciously associate low color saturation with a product's “gentler” impact on the environment. This perception of eco-friendliness, in turn, increases their trust in the product maker's greenness. Our research disentangles the direct and indirect impact (via consumers' perceptions of materials' naturalness, product authenticity, and product durability) of low-saturation colors on the perceived eco-friendliness of consumer products. Furthermore, the results reveal that, by fostering perceptions of eco-friendliness and green trust, such colors favorably influence consumers' behavioral intentions (i.e., their purchase intention and intention to pay a premium price for the product). Ultimately, the paper provides useful insights for companies and marketers interested in leveraging the meaning of color saturation to elicit perceptions of environmental compatibility. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	10.1002/mar.21858	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161974483&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21858&partnerID=40&md5=485514c397e4358d646f0dbd38b6f285
Panzone L.A.; Tocco B.; Brečić R.; Gorton M.	PTBG_2024	Healthy foods, healthy sales? Cross-category effects of a loyalty program promoting sales of fruit and vegetables	2024	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of Retailing	Globally, consumption of Fruit and Vegetables (F&V) remains below nutritional guidelines. With retailers accounting for a large portion of F&V sales, marketing can be key to increase F&V consumption at household level. However, a key challenge is the design of strategies that benefit retailers, e.g., improving loyalty, whilst promoting societal goals. This study evaluates a points-plus-cash loyalty program where participants received points by purchasing selected F&V, redeemable against a reward (plush toys in the shape of F&V). We estimate the impact of the program by comparing expenditures in several categories before, during, and after the promotional period, across two different years, and comparing consumers who redeemed a reward and those who did not. We use loyalty card data from a Croatian retailer, containing food expenditure in five categories for 268,359 consumers, over 27 weeks for 2 years. We find that the loyalty program increased F&V expenditures at the focal retailer during the promotional period. However, the increase was only for reward-redeemers, for whom the program increased expenditures in F&V as well as in other food categories. This effect persisted – at a declining rate – after the program stopped. Exposure only had a limited effect during the campaign, leading to a reduction in expenditure after the promotional period. Results indicate that a loyalty program promoting sales of F&V can create win-win benefits to both society and the retailer: it increases expenditures on healthy foods (F&V), while improving overall loyalty (i.e., expenditures) to the retailer amongst motivated consumers. © 2023 The Author(s)	10.1016/j.jretai.2023.12.002	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85182667282&doi=10.1016%2fj.jretai.2023.12.002&partnerID=40&md5=44d39d9327f54010bc109177db35fdc2

PWS_2013	Good and guilt-free: The role of self-accountability in influencing preferences for products with ethical attributes	2013	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Marketing	The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals. © 2013, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jm.11.0454	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873312842&doi=10.1509%2fjm.11.0454&partnerID=40&md5=7a246b69f1c7eaa3c02d8bdaf6311124

RHEF_2024	Activating the sustainable consumer:The role of customer involvement in corporate sustainability	2024	Experiments	Yes	Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science	Tackling grand challenges and making sustainable development a reality through sustainable consumption crucially depends upon both companies’ activities as well as individuals’ consumption choices. In opinion polls, many consumers claim to favor sustainable products over conventional ones. However, a large gap remains between their stated purchasing intentions and actual decisions, posing a challenge for companies in predicting product demand and strategically managing their product portfolios. In this study, we develop a conceptual framework to demonstrate how companies can encourage sustainable consumption behavior among their customers by involving them in their corporate sustainability (CS) activities. We introduce psychological ownership as the underlying mechanism explaining how customer involvement in CS activities translates into changes in their consumption choices. We further argue that the link between customer involvement and psychological ownership depends on the type of a company’s CS—that is, whether CS is embedded in or peripheral to the company’s core business. The results from three experiments, including one field experiment conducted in collaboration with a fashion retailer and involving real customer purchase decisions, support our theorizing. The findings reveal the power of customer involvement as a marketing tool in promoting sustainable consumption. © The Author(s) 2024.	10.1007/s11747-024-01036-7	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199292459&doi=10.1007%2fs11747-024-01036-7&partnerID=40&md5=b0956a7d6fb2c360649b6da4ce58b893
M. Ross S.; Kapitan S.	RK_2018	Balancing self/collective-interest: equity theory for prosocial consumption	2018	Experiments	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: This work aims to use equity theory to explore how consumers assess prosocial actions as part of a mental portfolio of purchases and behaviors in a broader marketplace, seeking balance in market exchanges. Conceptualizing marketing exchange as both an exchange of perceived value and a balance between self- and collective-interest allows for segmentation by consumer sensitivity to equity and sheds light on why prosocial consumption might occur. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies validate and segment consumers via their equity sensitivity. Between-subject designs with samples of consumers and marketing managers validate an equity sensitivity index that segments how people balance self- and collective-interests in marketplace exchange and predicts prosocial consumption choices. Findings: The results indicate that Entitled decision makers are more willing to exchange collective-interest for self-interest and emphasize choices that maximize lower prices for consumers or greater profits for firms in lieu of prosocial outcomes. Benevolent decision makers, however, are more willing to exchange self-interest for collective-interest and support prosocial outcomes. Originality/value: This work moves beyond research that focuses on attitudes, values and situational factors, instead using equity theory to uncover broader marketplace motivations for prosocial consumption. The research reveals that a motivating force behind prosocial consumption is how much consumers perceive they have given to, and gotten, from, the marketplace. Segmenting the market according to how consumers balance gains and losses provides an alternate approach to studying prosocial consumption, as well as a practical approach to developing targeted marketing strategies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.	10.1108/EJM-01-2017-0002	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044502644&doi=10.1108%2fEJM-01-2017-0002&partnerID=40&md5=816dc1e9b80562661668aaa2cd404e30

Most popular press says yes, but industry remains slow to act upon such initiatives. Drawing upon recent research in the Industrial Marketing Management Sustainability Special Issue, this research investigates the impact of green initiatives on firm performance and how the related commitment of resources impacts the effectiveness of those initiatives. The goal of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of green marketing on firm performance, in terms of financial performance, market performance, and service quality. Further, resource commitment is examined as a possible boundary condition of these relationships. Using multi-source data, the findings suggest that the commitment of proper resources is critical to the success of any green initiative. This study also supports the notion that being the first firm in an industry to initiate a green program provides few tangible benefits. More importantly, even firms with an environmental focus neglect to realize superior performance unless the specific strategy is matched with consistent support from top management. © 2014.	10.1016/j.indmarman.2014.06.014	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84909990918&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2014.06.014&partnerID=40&md5=21bb7f66a8512479b3a03374b41fcd4c

RWDCL_2019	Pride in my past: Influencing sustainable choices through behavioral recall	2019	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Emotional appraisal research has demonstrated that recalling a past behavior and its associated emotions can influence future behavior. However, how such recalled emotions shape sustainable consumer choice has not been examined. This study examines the role of recalled pride and guilt in shaping sustainable purchase intentions and the mediating role of anticipated pride and guilt. A conceptual model is proposed for motivating sustainable purchase intentions through the emotions associated with the behavioral recall. The model is applied in two experiments with online consumers examining purchase intentions of low carbon cars. Recalling feelings of pride associated with a past sustainability-related behavior increases sustainable purchase intention, as compared with a neutral recall. This effect occurs through the mediation of both anticipated pride at the prospect of a sustainable behavior choice and anticipated guilt if the future choice is not sustainable. Similar hypotheses relating to recalled guilt at past unsustainable behavior were not supported. The study contributes to research on sustainable consumption, revealing an emotional route by which past behavior can influence future behavior. It also adds to emotional appraisal research by showing the role of specific self-conscious emotions in forming this route, as prior research has focused more broadly on emotional valence. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	10.1002/mar.21178	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060738413&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21178&partnerID=40&md5=edca5af8939a103625c0641c1440b338

SBHA_2024	Engaging customers and suppliers for environmental sustainability: Investigating the drivers and the effects on firm performance	2024	Field Survey	Yes	Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science	While firms engage stakeholders in their sustainability practices to contribute to a better world resiliently and responsibly, little is known about what drives their ability to generate customer engagement (CE) and supplier engagement (SE) for sustainability purposes. This paper identifies, theorizes, and empirically validates the differential roles of board oversight and incentivization, along with contingencies (a chief marketing officer’s (CMO) presence and governance disclosure), in driving CE and SE. Using data from 308 firms, the paper finds that while board oversight and incentivization positively affect CE, only incentivization positively affects SE. The paper also finds significant moderation effects of CMO presence and governance disclosure. Through multiple post hoc analyses, the paper explores how CE and SE influence firm performance.

Sun J.J.; Bellezza S.; Paharia N.	SBP_2021	Buy Less, Buy Luxury: Understanding and Overcoming Product Durability Neglect for Sustainable Consumption	2021	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Marketing	The authors propose that purchasing luxury can be a unique means to engage in sustainable consumption because high-end products are particularly durable. Six studies examine the sustainability of high-end products, investigate consumers’ decision making when considering high-end versus ordinary goods, and identify effective marketing strategies to emphasize product durability, an important and valued dimension of sustainable consumption. Real-world data on new and secondhand accessories demonstrate that high-end goods can be more sustainable than mid-range products because they have a longer life cycle. Furthermore, consumers engage in more sustainable behaviors with high-end goods, owning them for longer and disposing of them in more environmentally friendly manners. Nevertheless, many consumers prefer to concentrate their budget on multiple ordinary goods in lieu of fewer high-end products partly because of product durability neglect, a failure to consider how long a product will last. Although consumers generally believe that high-end products last longer, they fail to take such a notion into account when making purchases. Finally, this research offers actionable strategies for marketers to help consumers overcome product durability neglect and nudge them toward concentrating their budget on fewer high-end, durable products. © American Marketing Association 2021.	10.1177/0022242921993172	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104406099&doi=10.1177%2f0022242921993172&partnerID=40&md5=c0ac85d41d0fbcc91cac5fcaad8a2646

We assess the moderating effect of global cultural identity on the relationship between materialism and environmentally friendly tendencies using three different conceptualizations and measures of global cultural identity - the lifestyle and brand dimensions of global consumption orientation and global connectedness. In emerging markets, we observe strong positive effects of materialism on the concern for environmentally friendly products, the willingness to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, perceptions of global companies as environmentally friendly, and the likelihood to engage in environmentally friendly tendencies for the global segment across all three conceptualizations of global cultural identity; in addition, for individuals with a glocal cultural identity, we observe a significant positive relationship between materialism and these measures of environmentally friendly tendencies. In developed markets, significant effects are observed only for the global segment, but specific effects depend on the conceptualization of a global cultural identity. Therefore, our results indicate that multinational companies focused on combining materialistic appeals with their green positioning in the emerging markets must carefully target consumers with a strong global cultural identity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.	10.1016/j.ijresmar.2012.08.003	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84873146871&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijresmar.2012.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=957f2a68ac3e643b45362eb1865c54c1

How Consumers Respond to (In)Consistently Sustainable Packaged Products in the Presence of Sustainability Claims	2023	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Advertising	Firms often emphasize “green” benefits for products that are only partially more sustainable than alternatives (e.g., a more sustainable packaging with similar product ingredients). The current article posits that such strategies can lead to a perceived claim–fact discrepancy and examines to what extent this makes consumers feel deceived and detracts from attitudes and purchase intentions, even though consumers can intrinsically value the (partial) sustainability improvements. In addition, given that marketing communication often relies on puffery such as exaggerated language and (visual) hyperbole, the article also investigates the effect of the use of puffery versus more subdued claims. Findings from two experiments unveil that when the actual sustainability of packaged products is (partially) discrepant with an overt sustainability claim, this leads to higher perceived deception. The use of puffery has both pros and cons, such that it adds to perceived sustainability but also to perceived deception, and it moderates the effects of actual sustainability. Furthermore, the results provide initial support for the idea that sustainability improvements in only peripheral attributes (packaging) are perceived as more deceptive than sustainability improvements in only central attributes (product contents). © 2022 The Author(s).

Sokolova T.; Krishna A.; Döring T.	SKD_2011	Paper Meets Plastic: The Perceived Environmental Friendliness of Product Packaging	2023	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Consumer Research	Packaging waste makes up more than 10% of the landfilled waste in the United States. While consumers often want to make environmentally friendly product choices, we find that their perceptions of the environmental friendliness of product packaging may systematically deviate from its objective environmental friendliness. Eight studies (N = 4,103) document the perceived environmental friendliness (PEF) bias whereby consumers judge plastic packaging with additional paper to be more environmentally friendly than identical plastic packaging without the paper. The PEF bias is driven by consumers' "paper = good, plastic = bad"beliefs and by proportional reasoning, wherein packaging with a greater paper-to-plastic proportion is judged as more environmentally friendly. We further show that the PEF bias impacts consumers' willingness to pay and product choice. Importantly, this bias can be mitigated by a "minimal packaging sticker"intervention, which increases the environmental friendliness perceptions of plastic-only packaging, rendering plastic-packaged products to be preferable to their plastic-plus-paper-packaged counterparts. This research contributes to the packaging literature in marketing and to research on sustainability while offering practical implications for managers and public policy officials.  © 2023 The Author(s).	10.1093/jcr/ucad008	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163856892&doi=10.1093%2fjcr%2fucad008&partnerID=40&md5=cca9c8e651b9ab93371c7c334a368d6f
Sangwan V.; Maity M.; Tripathi S.; Chakraborty A.	SMTC_2024	From discomfort to desirable: The effect of embarrassment on prosocial consumption	2024	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Embarrassment plays a pivotal role in the consumer landscape by significantly influencing consumers' purchase and consumption experiences. While marketing scholarship has primarily focused on the undesirable facets of embarrassment, the present research examines the positive outcomes of embarrassment for consumers, firms, and the environment. Based on costly signaling theory, this research seeks to determine the effect of embarrassment on consumer preferences toward prosocial products. Using six experimental studies (including one in the Supporting Information: Appendix), we demonstrate that embarrassment positively influences the purchase intention for environment-friendly and sustainable products. Using lab and consequential studies, we show that the motivation to repair the social image mediates the effect of embarrassment on prosocial product preference. We also identify that public self-consciousness moderates this effect, such that embarrassed individuals with high (vs. low) public self-consciousness exhibit higher prosocial product preference. We also show that our core predictions on the effect of embarrassment on prosocial products is contingent upon the social context, such that embarrassment leads to enhanced intentions to repair social image and prosocial product preference in public but not in private purchase context. The results hold for various product categories. The findings contribute to a greater theoretical understanding of embarrassment by revealing a prosocial facet of the phenomenon. © 2024 The Authors.

Simpson B.J.K.; Radford S.K.	SR_2014	Situational variables and sustainability in multi-attribute decision-making	2014	Conjoint Experiment	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine whether consumers demonstrate a multi-dimensional understanding of sustainability in their decision-making and addresses the situational influence of confidence and compromise on sustainable product choices. Design/methodology/approach: Using three choice-based conjoint experiments the authors examined the importance of sustainability, compromise and confidence to consumers across two contexts. Two-step cluster analyses were used to segment consumers based on the importance scores. Findings: Data indicates that the environmental dimension of sustainability is the most influential followed by economic and social. The responses suggest three distinct segments identified as self-focused, trend motivated and reality driven that demonstrate significantly different characteristics in their approach to sustainable products. Research limitations/implications: Current research tends to focus on the environmental dimension, while paying little heed to the economic and social dimensions. This research indicates that consumers consider all three dimensions when making sustainable product choices and highlights that differences may emerge with respect to product utility. Practical implications: Firms must be aware that consumers differ in the importance they place on sustainability. The reality-driven segment is the most attractive segment, as they are highly engaged and are willing to invest time in understanding the complexities of sustainability.

Tal A.; Gvili Y.; Amar M.	TGA_2022	The influence of companies' moral associations on the product consumption experience: The role of moral disgust	2022	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Can moral associations linked with food products harm hedonic consumption experience? Across four studies, we show that moral associations linked to food that clash with values (racism and animal welfare) held by today's ethical consumers can engender moral disgust, which in turn undermines both expected and actual taste experience. The studies contribute to the literature by showing that associations impact consumption experience even in the absence of concrete actions, and by revealing moral disgust as the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Importantly, this effect was observed even when the moral associations involved racism or sustainability (e.g., animal welfare), which have no direct relationship to product quality. This reveals that mere moral associations, rather than quality associations, influence hedonic consumption experience, rather than quality associations. More broadly, the findings point to the ways in which extrinsic attributes affect product experience and evaluation, particularly in hedonic consumption. This may be particularly impactful for values clashing with those championed by ethical consumers. From a practical perspective, these studies provide a broader perspective on corporate social responsibility by showing that companies should exercise caution when exploiting the moral associations linked to their products. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	10.1002/mar.21704	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85131523850&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21704&partnerID=40&md5=a99fed11c1bfd1bded4ea84502d56f92
Tofighi M.; Grohmann B.; Bodur H.O.	TGB_2020	Ethical attribute and brand concept congruity enhances brand evaluations	2020	Experiments	Yes	European Journal of Marketing	Purpose: This paper aims to examine to what extent congruity between ethical attributes (i.e. product attributes with positive implications for the environment, human rights, social issues and animal welfare) and brand concept (i.e. the unique meaning associated with a brand in consumers’ minds) influences consumers’ evaluations of brands offering ethical attributes. Design/methodology/approach: Four studies involving North American consumers empirically tested the moderation effect of brand concept on consumer evaluations of ethical attributes and the mediating role of perceived congruity. Findings: This research finds an interactive effect of ethical attribute type and brand concept on brand evaluations, such that congruent ethical attribute–brand concept pairings (i.e. a utilitarian [symbolic] ethical attribute offered by a brand with a utilitarian [symbolic] brand concept) result in more favorable brand evaluations (Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4). Consumers’ perceptions of congruity between ethical attributes and brand concepts mediate this interactive effect (Studies 2 and 3). Moreover, a positive congruity effect of ethical attributes and brand concepts emerges at higher levels of conspicuous brand consumption (Study 4). Research limitations/implications: It is important to acknowledge that the current research did not specifically consider the case of utilitarian and symbolic ethical attribute offerings by luxury brands. This is a question that is left to future investigations. Practical implications: For marketing managers, findings indicate that brands gain from ethical attribute introductions only when these attributes are congruent with the brand concept. In addition, brands benefit to a greater extent from offering congruent ethical attributes when brand consumption is conspicuous. Originality/value: The findings of this research contribute to the literature on the effect of ethical attributes on consumers’ responses to brands and highlight the importance of brands’ choice of ethical attributes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.	10.1108/EJM-02-2018-0104	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076837953&doi=10.1108%2fEJM-02-2018-0104&partnerID=40&md5=ade8df34369dcafbac1b8aabc35fe62e
Tzanidis T.; Magni D.; Scuotto V.; Maalaoui A.	TMSM_2024	B2B green marketing strategies for European firms: Implications for people, planet and profit	2024	Field Survey	Yes	Industrial Marketing Management	The present research addresses the gap in studies on B2B marketing comparing a diverse set of socio-economic factors (ROA and Tobin’ s Q) and its effects on people, planet, and profit. Studies in the past have shown that firms haven't been able to gain a long-term competitive advantage by using environmental strategies. Hence, the research analyses how 371 B2B firms from developed and emerging European countries achieve competitive advantage through green marketing strategies. Additionally, those firms are also assessed in reference to their level of engagement with environmental, social, and governance strategies. Our findings highlight that the more the engagement in green marketing by B2B firms, the greater the green competitive advantage that B2B firms in developed European markets can achieve. Hence, the study explores the relationship of B2B marketing, environmental sustainability, and corporate profitability, providing insights into how European firms can balance their financial objectives with their social and environmental responsibilities. The originality of the research stressed the need to pursue social and environmental goals and to preserve the future of people, planet, and profit through green marketing strategies. Investing in future business models and green competitive advantage is especially important for B2B European emerging firms' markets. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.	10.1016/j.indmarman.2024.01.018	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184471959&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2024.01.018&partnerID=40&md5=b17d68dcddbe308c2eb261a52ada3584

Across an empirical field analysis and eight controlled experiments, the authors show that consumers react less negatively to the failure of green products than conventional ones, which is referred to as the greenguard effect. The findings suggest that by not reacting negatively to green product failures, consumers believe they are being more prosocial, as their negative reaction may harm the success of a product that otherwise benefits the environment and society.

TRCMR_2018	Social sustainability as buying local: Effects of soft policy, meso-level actors, and social influences on purchase intentions	2018	Survey	Yes	Journal of Public Policy and Marketing	Recently issued United Nations Sustainable Development Goals call for people to make extensive behavioral changes, including consuming food more sustainably. The authors explore the role that meso-level retailers play in local purchasing, an activity that the United Nations recognizes as a contributor to sustainability. In so doing, the authors promote more balance within the marketing literature, which has focused more on the environmental component of products and purchasing and less on the local dimension. This article spotlights “soft” policies, those that use persuasion and encourage voluntary action, rather than direct methods, such as subsidies and regulations. The authors develop a core hypothesis about how social norm messages and attitudes toward local food affect consumer purchase intentions. They test this hypothesis across national contexts via online surveys of 316 Italian consumers (Study 1) and 186 U.S. consumers (Study 2). The analysis reveals that in both countries, the effectiveness of social norm messages increases with unfavorable attitudes toward local buying. The study concludes with thoughts for researchers and policy makers about how meso-level actors, such as retailers, can elicit more local purchasing. © 2018, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jppm.16.215	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063484399&doi=10.1509%2fjppm.16.215&partnerID=40&md5=0585ddadc6f8cd3bf3656355634a42fd

TT_2023	Making brand activism successful: How advice-giving can boost support behavior and reap benefits for the brand	2023	Experiments	Yes	Marketing Letters	Brand activism, i.e., taking a public stance towards sociopolitical issues, is a controversial strategic marketing tool for firms. Prior work shows that at best, it has no significant positive impact on consumer support and outcomes for brands. In this research, we propose and explore how advice-giving impacts consumer brand activism support and brand liking. Across four studies we find that advice-giving leads to more successful brand activism by increasing brand activism support behavior, and also has benefits for the brand. We show that advice-giving drives higher levels of normative influence which leads to higher brand activism support behavior. We also study a boundary condition and show that even when brands do not follow consumers’ advice, advice-giving has no negative behavioral and attitudinal consequences for the brand. Overall, we contribute to literature on brand activism and advice-giving and help marketers in strategically and effectively designing their brand activism activities. © 2023, The Author(s).	10.1007/s11002-023-09677-4	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85153409494&doi=10.1007%2fs11002-023-09677-4&partnerID=40&md5=41372a4309eaef515ac23485a3daa462
Wood S.	W_2012	Prone to progress: Using personality to identify supporters of innovative social entrepreneurship	2012	Survey	Yes	Journal of Public Policy and Marketing	One of the main challenges in social entrepreneurship is capturing stakeholder support-from consumers, to legislators, to volunteers, to many others. Identifying likely supporters is the first step to sustainable success, but a difficult one. This research examines whether personality influences a person's tendency to support innovative social entrepreneurial (SE) ventures. Here, the possible influence of the "Big Five" personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism [OCEAN]) is examined; however, in line with prior research, attention is focused on both openness (an OCEAN trait) and empathy (a non-OCEAN trait). Two types of SE ventures are considered: social innovations and technological innovations. Data from a survey evaluating six SE ventures (three social and three technological) reveal that participants' personality influences support; however, observed influence differs by type of venture-openness underlies support of technological innovations, and empathy underlies support of social innovations. Further process analysis demonstrates that this influence is not direct but rather is mediated by people's perceptions of how much change the venture will make. These results offer social entrepreneurs insights into who might be prone to support SE ventures and, more important, why. © 2012, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jppm.11.060	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862570159&doi=10.1509%2fjppm.11.060&partnerID=40&md5=c8b4a650d7bccc8d35ad1042eb7bdc2e

The results show that shoppers of a high-status sustainable grocery chain display sustainable shopping more by using branded shopping bags than shoppers of a lower-status chain.

Wang W.; Krishna A.; McFerran B.	WKM_2017	Turning off the lights: Consumers' environmental efforts depend on visible efforts of firms	2017	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Marketing Research	Firms can save considerable money if consumers conserve resources (e.g., if hotel patrons turn off the lights when leaving the room, if restaurant patrons use fewer paper napkins, if airline passengers clean up after themselves). In two studies conducted in real-world hotels, the authors show that consumers' conservation behavior is affected by the extent to which consumers perceive the firm as being green. Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers' conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer, and the environment. © 2017, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jmr.14.0441	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85023647387&doi=10.1509%2fjmr.14.0441&partnerID=40&md5=8ded903136cc9e9d1c6569024736051c
Wan C.; Lee D.; Ng P.	WLN_2024	The role of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in encouraging low- versus high-cost pro-environmental behaviors	2024	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Virtual influencers have great potential to shape the audience's perception and motivate behavioral change. Drawing upon anthropomorphism theory and social identity theory, this paper examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in shaping audiences' trust and subsequently pro-environmental behaviors in low- and high-cost contexts. Two online studies employing experimental materials generated by artificial intelligence were conducted. Study 1 revealed that high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) and high racial homophily (local-like virtual influencers) are more effective for eliciting trust in the context of low-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) would further weaken the trust level of a virtual influencer in low anthropomorphism (animate-like virtual influencers). Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in the context of high-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) enhanced the trust in a high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) virtual influencer. The moderated mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. This research advanced our understanding on the moderating role of racial homophily that serves as a cognitive shortcut for low-cost and quick decisions. However, a low racial homophily (foreign-like) virtual influencer would be more effective for high-cost and symbolic pro-environmental behaviors. These insights provide valuable guidance to businesses, marketers, and environmental advocates aiming to leverage virtual influencers for encouraging sustainability practices. © 2024 The Authors.

Using Joint Motives to Increase Credibility of Sustainability Efforts	2023	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Public Policy and Marketing	Consumer perceptions of brand motives related to corporate environmental responsibility affect the decisions of both corporations and consumers. Yet prior literature has typically viewed these firm motives as dichotomous, either solely intrinsic or solely extrinsic. The authors argue for a novel approach to positioning sustainability motives, where the brand communicates both intrinsic and extrinsic benefits together, as a joint motive. With a joint motive, a brand can highlight how an effort can benefit both planet and business with a “doing well by doing good” approach. Across five experiments, including a field study on Facebook, this research investigates the positive impact of the joint motive and its ability to enhance the credibility of sustainable initiatives via heightened perceptions of trustworthiness and expertise. Results provide converging evidence for the benefits of presenting a joint motive for sustainability efforts with implications for policy and practice. © American Marketing Association 2022.	10.1177/07439156221138755	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145739691&doi=10.1177%2f07439156221138755&partnerID=40&md5=275b7853b7837ab5bcb6685206002a30
Wei Y.; Pujari D.	WP2_2023	Does buying green pay off? Stock market reactions to green acquisitions	2023	Field Survey	Yes	Industrial Marketing Management	As sustainability trends gain momentum, more businesses seek to expand their green business portfolios by acquiring firms with green technologies or green brands. However, the financial impact of this green marketing strategy is unclear. Utilizing event study methodology and the two-stage Heckman selection model, this study investigates stock market valuations of 182 announcements about green acquisitions from US public firms between 2000 and 2018. We report several interesting findings. First, we find that green acquisitions are accompanied by positive stock market reactions. Second, the stock market reacts more favorably to acquirers with a higher level of marketing capability and a lower level of innovation capability when green acquisitions are announced. Third, industry sensitivity moderates the effects of the two aforementioned organizational capabilities on the stock market return−green acquisition relationship. We gain insight into investor responses in the context of green acquisitions through the lens of marketing and innovation capabilities. The findings enrich research in the domain of marketing−finance interface and sustainability marketing by shedding light on the short-term green acquisition–firm value relationship. © 2023	10.1016/j.indmarman.2023.08.001	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167966196&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2023.08.001&partnerID=40&md5=d185797dea465f2311d036543d1c73c0
Whittaker L.; Russell-Bennett R.; Mulcahy R.	WRM_2021	Reward-based or meaningful gaming? A field study on game mechanics and serious games for sustainability	2021	Field Study	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	Despite investigating digital gaming for commercial purposes, less scholarly attention exists on digital gaming for societal purposes such as sustainability (“serious games”). The current study investigates whether a serious game can enhance sustainability marketing outcomes, including knowledge, value-in-behavior, and behavioral intentions longitudinally (pre-gameplay to post-gameplay). Further, the study seeks to understand the influence of reward-based and meaningful game mechanics on these sustainability marketing outcomes. We recruited 387 participants for a week-long field study using a serious game which encourages household energy conservation. The findings show that the serious game significantly increased sustainability knowledge, value-in-behavior, and sustainable behavioral intention after one week. Reward-based game mechanics (badges and trophies) significantly influenced sustainability knowledge and indirectly influenced value-in-behavior via sustainability knowledge, whereas reward-based (points) and meaningful (educational messages) game mechanics had little impact. The results empirically support the conceptual model theorization—underpinned by a “do–learn–feel” behavioral learning approach—which possessed superior fit to a “do–feel–learn” rival model. This study provides novel insights regarding eliciting value-in-behavior longitudinally within serious games. Our multidimensional approach to assessing reward-based game mechanics extends prior studies and suggests that higher-tier rewards are more influential than lower-tiered rewards to achieve sustainability marketing outcomes. We further demonstrate that reward-based game mechanics outperform meaningful game mechanics at influencing desired outcomes, challenging existing gaming literature. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	10.1002/mar.21476	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102533674&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21476&partnerID=40&md5=90e06b6720235f6a13654e35aa00c2bf
White K.; Simpson B.	WS_2013	When do (and don't) normative appeals influence sustainable consumer behaviors	2013	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Marketing	The authors explore how injunctive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others think one should do), descriptive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others are doing), and benefit appeals (i.e., highlighting the benefits of the action) can encourage consumers to engage in relatively unfamiliar sustainable behaviors such as "grasscycling" and composting. Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers, marketers, and public policy makers. © 2013, American Marketing Association.	10.1509/jm.11.0278	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84874644504&doi=10.1509%2fjm.11.0278&partnerID=40&md5=6229be2b740d7e6195c05c6cd5631947
Zhang W.; Chintagunta P.K.; Kalwani M.U.	ZCK_2021	Social Media, Influencers, and Adoption of an Eco-Friendly Product: Field Experiment Evidence from Rural China	2021	Field Study	Yes	Journal of Marketing	Can low-cost marketing tools that are used to enhance business performance also contribute to creating a better world? The authors investigate the role of online social media tools in alleviating customer (farmer) uncertainty and promoting the adoption of a new eco-friendly pesticide in rural China via a randomized controlled field experiment. The key finding is that even for a new product such as a pesticide, a low-cost social media support platform can effectively promote adoption. A combination of information from peers and from the firm on the platform facilitates learning about product features and alleviates uncertainty associated with product quality and appropriate product usage. Nevertheless, at the trial stage of the funnel, the platform underperforms the firm’s customized one-on-one support because available information does not resolve uncertainty in supplier credibility and product authenticity. Having an influencer on the platform, albeit not an expert on this product, vouching for its credibility helps resolve this funnel-holdup problem. From a theoretical perspective, this paper provides suggestive evidence for referent influence and credibility signaling on social media platforms and consequences for new product trial. The authors also provide direct empirical evidence on how information facilitates learning, a phenomenon typically assumed to be present in studies estimating learning models. © The Author(s) 2021.	10.1177/0022242920985784	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104385281&doi=10.1177%2f0022242920985784&partnerID=40&md5=8db4424156015359932b25cf54070071

The effect of willful ignorance on judgments of others	2016	Experiments	Yes	Journal of Consumer Psychology	This research shows that consumers who willfully ignore ethical product attributes denigrate other, more ethical consumers who seek out and use this information in making purchase decisions. Across three studies, willfully ignorant consumers negatively judge ethical others they have never met across various disparate personality traits (e.g., fashionable, boring). The denigration arises from the self-threat inherent in negative social comparison with others who acted ethically instead of choosing not to do so. In addition, this denigration has detrimental downstream consequences, undermining the denigrator's commitment to ethical values, as evidenced by reduced anger toward firms who violate the ethical principle in question and reduced intention to behave ethically in the future. There are two moderators of the effect: Denigration becomes less strong if willfully ignorant consumers have a second opportunity to act ethically after initially ignoring the ethical product information and also significantly weakens if initially ignoring the ethical attribute is seen as justifiable. These results have implications for understanding ethical consumption behavior, perceptions of ethical consumerism in general, and marketing of ethical products. © 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.	10.1016/j.jcps.2015.10.002	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949257212&doi=10.1016%2fj.jcps.2015.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=f72009b39e9fedc61a885b26f63a0622
Zhang R.; Ma Q.; Guan D.	ZMG_2023	The impact of financial scarcity on green consumption: Sequential mediating effects of anxiety and self-efficacy	2023	Experiments	Yes	Psychology and Marketing	There is a consensus to promote green consumption to drive sustainable human development and high-quality economic development. It is therefore essential for academics, policymakers, and marketers to understand the factors that influence green consumption. Through four experiments, this study examines the effect of financial scarcity—a feeling commonly experienced by consumers—on green consumption. These experiments show that financial scarcity can hinder consumers' choice of green products. The above process occurs because the scarcity of monetary resources induces anxiety, which in turn reduces self-efficacy. We further find that the observed effect will be attenuated when consumers' social support level is high (vs. low). These findings demonstrate that the impact of financial scarcity on green consumption is mediated by anxiety and self-efficacy perception and moderated by social support. Our results provide recommendations for developing marketing strategies for green products. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.	10.1002/mar.21801	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149362570&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21801&partnerID=40&md5=1e85298e62c510266a5f3f4544eea06d
