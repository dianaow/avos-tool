Abadie A.; Chowdhury S.; Mangla S.K.; Malik S.	ACMM_2024	Impact of carbon offset perceptions on greenwashing: Revealing intentions and strategies through an experimental approach	Experiments	Yes	2024	Organizations operating in the Business-to-Business (B2B) ecosystem across the globe are committed to net zero initiatives to achieve sustainability across business processes. In this context, carbon carbon credits have emerged as a carbon offsetting mechanism to help organizations invest in low-carbon initiatives. However, existing studies are yet to examine whether carbon offsetting practices will influence the sustainability behavior of B2B organizations and whether it could lead to greenwashing propensity. In this vein, we adopt agency and revealed pereferences theories to conduct two experiments with B2B small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) managers operating in the UK process intensive sectors to reveal that affordability of carbon credits can motivate managers to engage in sustainable attitudes and practices. We also found that organizations willing to buy carbon credits at high price to are likely to engage in high greenwashing propensity. Considering these novel findings, we provide recommendations that will help organizations to become more responsible in their carbon offesteing investments, and for policy makers to adopt stringent assessment of such investments and carbon disclosures made by firms. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Amatulli C.; De Angelis M.; Donato C.	ADD_2021	The atypicality of sustainable luxury products	Experiments	Yes	2021	This study tackles the issue of how consumers might perceive luxury products' sustainability-focused communication. We compare consumers' reactions when luxury brands communicate their focus on either product sustainability or product excellence (i.e., a sustainability- vs. excellence-focused communication strategy, respectively). We predict that consumers perceive the former as more atypical for a luxury brand, which renders the communication more effective at enhancing consumers' willingness to buy the brand's products. Across six experiments, we demonstrate that perceived atypicality mediates the effect of luxury product communication strategy on consumers' willingness to buy; that perceived atypicality increases willingness to buy by increasing consumers' perception about the uniqueness of the communication strategy; that the effect of perceived atypicality is stronger for consumers with a higher chronic need for uniqueness; and that the greater effectiveness of a sustainability-focused communication strategy on atypicality and willingness to buy is peculiar to luxury products (i.e., it does not manifest for mass-market products). From a managerial perspective, our findings demonstrate that luxury brands may innovate their communication strategies by leveraging sustainability rather than product excellence. © 2021 The Authors.

Amatulli C.; De Angelis M.; Pino G.; Guido G.	ADPG_2020	An investigation of unsustainable luxury: How guilt drives negative word-of-mouth	Experiments	Yes	2020	This research investigates consumers' reactions to luxury versus mass-market fashion products that are produced in an unsustainable manner. In particular, this research empirically assesses whether and why third-party information revealing the unsustainable nature of luxury versus mass-market fashion products may increase consumers' intention to engage in negative word-of-mouth about the manufacturing company. The results of four experiments demonstrate that, when confronted with information revealing that a purchased luxury fashion product has been produced in an environmentally or socially unsustainable manner, consumers experience a higher sense of guilt over that product, compared to a purchased mass-market fashion product, due to their lower expectations about luxury fashion products' unsustainability. Guilt, in turn, drives consumers' intention to generate negative word-of-mouth about the producer and such an effect is more pronounced among consumers with a higher versus lower individualistic orientation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Amatulli C.; De Angelis M.; Pino G.; Jain S.	ADPJ_2021	Consumer reactions to unsustainable luxury: a cross-country analysis	Experiments	Yes	2021	Purpose: This paper investigates why and when messages regarding unsustainable luxury products lead to negative word-of-mouth (NWOM) through a focus on the role of guilt, need to warn others and consumers' cultural orientation. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments test whether messages describing unsustainable versus sustainable luxury manufacturing processes elicit guilt and a need to warn others and whether and how the need to warn others affects consumers' NWOM depending on their cultural orientation. Findings: Consumers experience guilt in response to messages emphasizing the unsustainable (vs sustainable) nature of luxury products. In turn, guilt triggers a need to warn other consumers, which leads to NWOM about the luxury company. Furthermore, the results suggest that two dimensions of Hofstede's model of national culture – namely individualism/collectivism and masculinity/femininity – moderate the effect of the need to warn others on NWOM. Practical implications: Luxury managers should design appropriate strategies to cope with consumers' different reactions to information regarding luxury brands' unsustainability. Managers should be aware that the risk of NWOM diffusion may be higher in countries characterized by a collectivistic and feminine orientation rather than an individualistic and masculine orientation. Originality/value: Consumer reaction to unsustainable luxury, especially across different cultural groups, is a neglected area of investigation. This work contributes to this novel area of research by investigating NWOM stemming from unsustainable luxury manufacturing practices in different cultural contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Acuti D.; Lemarie L.; Viglia G.	ALV_2023	The impact of communication and proximity on citizens’ sustainable disposal of e-waste	Field Experiment	Yes	2023	Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how decision-makers can enhance citizens’ sustainable disposal of e-waste through bin proximity and ad hoc communication. Specifically, the authors discuss a two-year research project that took place in Northern Italy, where the authors documented the number of products disposed of sustainably in four towns. Design/methodology/approach: The project involved five main groups of stakeholders: i) four municipalities, ii) one social purpose organisation employing people with disabilities, (i.e. Andromeda), iii) one provider of bins (i.e. PubliCittà), iv) another social purpose organisation entity (i.e. Fondazione CRT) and v) the University of Portsmouth. After conducting three online pilot tests to confirm expectations of this study regarding how to enhance citizens’ sustainable disposal of e-waste, the authors have implemented the field pilot programme in a small municipality and successively in other three towns. Finally, the authors measured the impact of the programme on the actual recycling rate of citizens in the three target municipalities. Findings: The authors found that the positioning of drop-off bins in such a way as to reduce the distance from as many households as possible, along with the use of communication that facilitates the understanding of information related to sustainable disposal schemes, can improve the sustainable behaviour of citizens. The sustainable disposal of exhausted batteries after the intervention improved by 135% on average in the three municipalities that adopted the disposal scheme (Saluggia, San Benigno Canavese and Santhiá). The disposal rate of toners and electronics increased by 204.0% and 318.75% (San Benigno Canavese) and 138.7% and 85.4% (Santhiá), respectively. Research limitations/implications: The authors believe it would be cautious to consider potential differences in terms of recycling cultures and facilities before implementing the programme in other countries. Practical implications: The authors’ contribution shows decision-makers how to effectively design disposal schemes to enhance citizens' sustainable behaviour. The authors demonstrate how the thoughtful and responsible use of marketing levers can affect environmental sustainability and impact social development. Social implications: This paper has an actual impact on society by changing citizens’ behaviour, reducing harm to the environment and human well-being and supporting the inclusion of disadvantaged people in sustainability-oriented programmes. Originality/value: The structured and equitable engagement of scholars with multiple stakeholders can lead to the co-creation of societal value and knowledge and improve the well-being of multiple stakeholders. The collaboration between academics and practitioners enables the definition of effective strategies by observing the actual behaviour of individuals (i.e. citizens) and offers a direct and measurable impact on society. The involvement of social purpose organisations reinforces the shared primary aim of achieving measurable social and environmental impact. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Antonetti P.; Maklan S.	AM_2014	Exploring Postconsumption Guilt and Pride in the Context of Sustainability	Mixed Methods	Yes	2014	This research explores the feelings of guilt and pride experienced by consumers after a purchase decision that involves issues of environmental and social sustainability. Through a multi-method design, the authors examine key dimensions that influence the process of emotional appraisal, illustrate the characteristics of appraisals of guilt/pride and investigate the consequences that emotions have on future choices. In this exploratory research, when a purchase decision includes an ethical dilemma, consumers were found to express guilt or pride even when the purchase is not intentional, i.e. forced by circumstances. Moreover, the study explores how emotions experienced after decisions may have a positive influence on the future purchase of sustainable alternatives. Finally, the paper proposes a new model that describes the process of emotional appraisal and reports on a number of dimensions that were found to lead to guilt and pride. The insights presented extend knowledge of two key consumer emotions and present important implications for practitioners promoting ethical products. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Brunneder J.; Dholakia U.	BD_2018	The self-creation effect: making a product supports its mindful consumption and the consumer’s well-being	Experiments	Yes	2018	Popular cultural movements such as Slow Food and the Maker Movement emphasize product self-creation―personally creating products, then consuming them, as a core value. We present the first research to examine how product self-creation affects the individual’s consumption experience of such products and their well-being. Seven field and lab studies provide evidence that when consumers self-create a product, they appreciate it to a greater degree, are likely to consume it more mindfully, and experience greater domain-specific and general well-being. The individual’s private self-consciousness strengthens the effect. Self-creating products offers consumers with a practical, versatile, and personal interest-driven way to transcend their traditional role, to consume more consciously and sustainably, while concurrently enhancing the enjoyment of their consumption experience. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

Bolton L.E.; Mattila A.S.	BM_2015	How does corporate social responsibility affect consumer response to service failure in buyer-seller relationships?	Experiments	Yes	2015	The researchers investigate how corporate social responsibility (CSR) affects customer response following service failure within the context of buyer-seller relationships. A series of three experiments demonstrate that CSR is more effective under communal (vs. exchange) relationship norms, consistent with the alignment of CSR with the communal norm of concern for the needs of others. The effectiveness of CSR is also shown to vary as a function of company motives and CSR framing, serving as theoretically and managerially relevant boundary conditions. Together, these findings increase our understanding of how and when CSR will have a positive impact on consumers and, in turn, companies via customer satisfaction and loyalty. © 2014 New York University.

Bowen K.T.; Musarra G.; Ou Y.-C.	BMO_2022	How and when Narcissism and faith in humanity drive sustainable consumption	Experiments	Yes	2022	The aim of this study is to examine how and when narcissism and faith in humanity simultaneously influence product reuse. Despite its critical role in promoting sustainability, scholars have paid scant attention to product reuse as a reliable aspect of sustainable consumer behavior. Moreover, research on personality traits as drivers of sustainable consumption has mostly focused on the Big Five personality traits. We posit that the effects of consumers' narcissism and faith in humanity on product reuse are explained by social exclusion and are conditional on subjective norms. We test our hypotheses using two experiments and three cross-sectional surveys. We find that while narcissism has a negative effect on product reuse, faith in humanity has a positive effect on product reuse. We also observe that social exclusion mediates the effects of narcissism and faith in humanity, and that subjective norms positively moderate the relationships between narcissism and product reuse. This study highlights the importance of product reuse as a key indicator of sustainable consumption and offers novel insights into the how and when consumers engage in product reuse. © 2022 The Authors.

Behl A.; Pereira V.; Jayawardena N.; Nigam A.; Mangla S.	BPJNM_2024	Gamification as an innovation: a tool to improve organizational marketing performance and sustainability of international firms	Field Survey	Yes	2024	Purpose: This study aims to investigate an under-researched area, an international marketing perspective, based on international dynamic capability, environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance in gamification and non-gamification-based organizational culture (OC). This paper deepens the understanding of gamification-based and non-gamification-based OC influence on innovation capability and environmental and organizational marketing performance through the theory of organizational creativity and the theory of administrative behavior (AB). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data from firms that abide by the ISO 14091 certifications to ensure the proper quality standards. Primary data from 384 firms are used to test the hypotheses. The results would help firms invest in technological solutions by practicing creativity over time. Additionally, the study helps explore how AB is critical in steering technological creativity for making firms climate-conscious. Findings: The study's findings identified that OC has a positive influence on technological innovation capabilities and environmental innovation capabilities. Technological innovation capabilities have a beneficial impact on environmental sustainability. Environmental sustainability appears to have a substantial correlation with technological innovation skills. Environmental innovation capabilities positively impact environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance. A moderating effect of gamification on the international dynamic capabilities within a relationship between organizational culture and environmental innovation capabilities exists. Originality/value: The investigation is confined to understanding how gamification-based and non-gamification-based organizational marketing culture affects innovation capability, environmental sustainability and organizational performance through the lens of theory of organizational creativity and theory of AB. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Balabanis G.; Stathopoulou A.; Chen X.	BSC_2024	A cross-cultural examination of sustainable luxury consumption: a comparative study of social norms, self-control and future orientation in the UK and China	Experimental	Yes	2024	Purpose: The study addresses gaps in sustainable luxury consumption research by analyzing the role of social norms in different cultural settings. It investigates how social norms, self-control, conspicuousness and future orientation shape sustainable luxury consumption in individualistic (UK) versus collectivist (China) national cultures. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on survey data from British and Chinese luxury product consumers collected through online panels. The final sample included 452 valid responses from the UK and 414 from China. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings: The study found that descriptive norms positively influence sustainable luxury consumption in individualistic (UK) and collectivist (China) cultures. Injunctive norms affect sustainable consumption only in the UK. Future consequences universally impact sustainable consumption. Conspicuous consumption negatively affects preferences for sustainable luxury brands. Self-control enhances the impact of descriptive norms in the UK but reduces the impact of injunctive norms in China. Originality/value: This study uniquely explores how social norms and cultural influences impact sustainable luxury consumption in individualistic and collectivistic societies. It highlights the moderating role of national culture, providing actionable insights for luxury brands to enhance sustainable consumption with culturally tailored strategies. The research challenges the universality of the theory of normative social behavior, advocating for its refined application across different cultures. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Cervellon M.-C.; Carey L.I.	CC_2014	Sustainable, hedonic and efficient: Interaction effects between product properties and consumer reviews on post-experience responses	Experiments	Yes	2014	Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the influence of consumer reviews on the evaluation, post-experience, of products with a combination of sustainable, hedonic and utilitarian properties. Design/methodology/approach - In the first instance, consumer reviews for organic and non-organic cosmetics posted on the French Web site beauté-test.com were analyzed. Second, a full-factorial two product types (organic and non-organic) x three reviews (positive, negative and no reviews) experiment was conducted. Sixty French women tested a beauty product and evaluated it on hedonic and utilitarian (ambiguous and non-ambiguous) properties. In a second experiment, 132 English-speaking students evaluated an herbal tea at home, along a full-factorial two product types (fair-trade and non-fair-trade) x three product properties (hedonic, utilitarian ambiguous and utilitarian non-ambiguous) x two reviews (negative review and no review) between-subject design. Findings - First, consumers are significantly less influenced by reviews for hedonic products compared to utilitarian products. In particular, they rely on reviews when evaluating utilitarian ambiguous properties (e.g. anti-aging properties) which they find difficult to judge on their own. Second, consumers are more resistant to the persuasive effect of reviews when the product focus is on sustainable (organic or fair-trade) credentials, in particular when judging ambiguous properties. Originality/value - This paper explores a topic neglected in the literature so far: the moderating role of product properties and sustainability, in particular, on consumers’ responses to persuasion and consumer reviews in the context of this paper. Its originality lies in the demonstration that consumers learn through product testing for hedonic and utilitarian unambiguous product properties and through consumer reviews for utilitarian ambiguous product properties. Additionally, it highlights the resistance of sustainable products (organic and fair-trade in this research) to negative product reviews. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Casalegno C.; Candelo E.; Santoro G.	CCS_2022	Exploring the antecedents of green and sustainable purchase behaviour: A comparison among different generations	Survey	Yes	2022	This paper investigates whether generation matters in the intention to buy green and sustainable products and, simultaneously, examines the antecedents of green and sustainable buying behaviour among three different generational cohorts (X, Y, and Z). By doing this, the present paper fills the gap regarding studies addressing the relationships between age and sustainable behaviour which have not included actual green and sustainable buying intention, along with the gap regarding studies only focussing on one or two (X and Y) generational cohorts. Drawing on the generational cohort theory, and by using a survey approach involving three samples of specific generations (X, Y, and Z), as well as by testing several hypotheses through ordinary least squares regression models, the paper finds that: (a) age plays a key role in the choice of green and socially friendly products, and (b) environmental concern and perceived consumer effectiveness are strong antecedents of green and sustainable purchase behaviour for all generational cohorts. This is also true for environmental citizenship, but this only applies to generations Y and Z. Finally, collectivism is only an antecedent of sustainable purchase behaviour for generation Z. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Cooremans K.; Geuens M.	CG_2019	Same but Different: Using Anthropomorphism in the Battle Against Food Waste	Experiments	Yes	2019	Food waste is a major threat to global sustainability. Much of it is caused by the aesthetic requirements imposed by retailers, which assume that consumers are not interested in buying misshapen produce unless it is accompanied by significant price discounts. This article proposes an alternative way to market such produce. A pilot study confirms consumers’ aversion to misshapen produce and identifies inferior taste perceptions as its dominant driver. Three studies then show that using anthropomorphism (i.e., attributing human characteristics to nonhuman objects) can increase purchase intentions for misshapen produce. Specifically, displaying misshapen produce with a smiling face and presenting shape abnormalities as body parts in point-of-purchase stimuli trigger positive affective reactions. These affective reactions enhance taste perceptions, thereby leading to higher purchase intentions and food choice. In addition, this research tests environmental concern as a moderator and measures actual behaviors in a grocery shopping context. The findings suggest an intervention that could be more effective than current public campaigns in the effort to curb waste along the entire food chain. © American Marketing Association 2019.

CGGN_2024	The impact of corporate social responsibility on consumer brand engagement and purchase intention at fashion retailers	Mixed Methods	Yes	2024	Consumers have demonstrated new ways of engaging with fashion retailers and experiencing their brand values. This research aims to understand better how fashion consumers form their purchase intentions, by exploring how their expectations about corporate social responsibility influence consumer brand engagement and purchase intention. The research comprises two studies, using different methodologies. The first study is quantitative; it involved 1296 individuals and the results were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The second study is qualitative and utilizes expert opinions from the fashion industry; it seeks to derive managerial and practical implications from the findings of the first study. The results show that corporate social responsibility influences the purchase intention of fashion consumers, but mainly through brand engagement. Consequently, fashion companies should focus on building consumer trust in the sustainability initiatives of brands, including by utilizing local suppliers. © 2023 The Authors.

Carter K.; Jayachandran S.; Murdock M.R.	CJM_2021	Building A Sustainable Shelf: The Role of Firm Sustainability Reputation	Experiments	Yes	2021	The reputation of firms for being environmentally friendly and socially responsible is a key purchase driver for sustainable products. However, the commitment of firms to sustainability varies – some firms are founded on strong environmental and social principles; other more traditional firms are built on strong product/brand focus and are not known for sustainability. In response to market trends, many traditional firms are introducing sustainable products to their portfolios. We argue that the firm's sustainability reputation (FSR) will influence consumer purchase with respect to equally sustainable products from different firms. Two choice studies demonstrate that FSR favors sustainable product choice when the consumer decides between equally sustainable products. However, FSR affects the choice only for sustainable products and not regular products and does so only for consumers that construe sustainability at a high (abstract) level. Retailers should pay attention to the role that FSR plays in consumer response when they select sustainable products to sell. © 2021 New York University	Journal of Retailing	10.1016/j.jretai.2021.03.003	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116718810&doi=10.1016%2fj.jretai.2021.03.003&partnerID=40&md5=4e6554e8f71cb15eb30a3a290a08ad33
Casidy R.; Lie D.S.	CL_2023	The effects of B2B sustainable brand positioning on relationship outcomes	Field Survey	Yes	2023	The global pandemic and the economic consequences that follow have impelled B2B firms to revisit their positioning strategy so as to emphasize sustainability. However, it is still unclear whether B2B firms would benefit from positioning themselves as sustainable organizations. Drawing upon social exchange theory, this study examines the role of commitment as the underlying mechanism whereby B2B sustainable brand positioning influences relationship outcomes. A study involving senior managers of Australian B2B firms revealed the critical role of calculative and affective commitment in mediating the relationship between B2B sustainable brand positioning on willingness-to-pay premium price (WTP) and switching intention. However, buyer-supplier value congruence influences the effects of sustainable brand positioning on calculative and affective commitment in the opposite direction. Specifically, value congruence positively moderates the effects of sustainable brand positioning on calculative commitment, but negatively moderates the effects of sustainable brand positioning on affective commitment. The findings provide empirical evidence supporting the benefits that B2B firms can obtain by adopting sustainable brand positioning. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Cakanlar A.; Nikolova H.; Nenkov G.Y.	CNN_2023	I Will Be Green for Us: When Consumers Compensate for Their Partners’ Unsustainable Behavior	Experiments	Yes	2023	In the context of romantic relationships, partners regularly observe each other's unsustainable behavior. But how do these unsustainable behaviors influence each member of the couple? This research shows that how consumers respond to their partners’ unsustainable behaviors depends on the amount of relationship power they possess: high-relationship-power individuals compensate for their partners’ unsustainable behavior by acting in a more sustainable manner relative to their baseline tendencies, but low-relationship-power individuals do not increase their own sustainable behavior. This effect occurs because high-relationship-power partners feel more responsible for the reconstruction of the couple identity after it has been damaged by their partner's unsustainable choice; as a result, they have a stronger desire to signal a positive couple identity (i.e., a positive couple sustainable identity). Consistent with this theory, this effect is attenuated for high-relationship-power individuals who have weak green identities. Seven studies provide evidence for these findings by measuring and manipulating relationship power and assessing hypothetical and actual sustainable behaviors. This research contributes to the sustainable behavior literature and highlights effective ways to promote sustainable behavior in households. © The Author(s) 2022.

Using a large data set collected in France around waste responsibilization, we demonstrate how waste pathways can generate spatiotemporal, guidance, and destructiveness tensions in households. Consumers respond to such tensions by keeping waste at home, which allows them to suspend, clarify, or reappropriate their waste responsibility. In delineating the waste responsibility tensions, our study reveals the boundaries of neoliberal governance’s success in mobilizing entrepreneurial consumers’ actions, namely, community structure/shared vision, emotions, and market demand. These boundaries illustrate the challenges for neoliberal governance in providing and maintaining for consumers an illusion of control through the crafting of heightened uncertainty, abstraction, and risk–benefit categorizations. This study has implications for waste management actors, as well as consumer researchers interested in neoliberal governance, consumer responsibilization, consumer activism, sustainability, and waste disposal. © The Author(s) 2022.

Catlin J.R.; Wang Y.	CW_2013	Recycling gone bad: When the option to recycle increases resource consumption	Experiments	Yes	2013	In this study, we propose that the ability to recycle may lead to increased resource usage compared to when a recycling option is not available. Supporting this hypothesis, our first experiment shows that consumers used more paper while evaluating a pair of scissors when the option to recycle was provided (vs. not provided). In a follow-up field experiment, we find that the per person restroom paper hand towel usage increased after the introduction of a recycling bin compared to when a recycling option was not available. We conclude by discussing implications for research and policy. © 2012 Society for Consumer Psychology.

The results of a survey including 250 Chinese manufacturing firms suggest that customer and competitor pressures have direct effects on environmental strategy proactivity. In addition, flexibility and control orientations play different roles in the relationships between these two market pressures and firms’ environmental strategy proactivity.

Das G.; Peloza J.; Varshneya G.; Green T.	DPVG_2021	When do consumers value ethical attributes? The role of perceived quality in gift-giving	Experiments	Yes	2021	Purpose: Although research demonstrates the importance of ethical product attributes for consumers, a prior study has not examined the role of consumption target (i.e. self-purchases vs gift-giving) on consumers’ preference for products with ethical attributes. Notably, consumers’ preference for quality can differ between self-purchases and gifts, and the presence of ethical attributes can impact product quality perceptions. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the presence of ethical attributes alters decision-making in a gift-giving context using perceptions of product quality as an explanatory variable for these differences. Design/methodology/approach: One field study and two controlled experiments test the proposed hypotheses. The experiments were conducted across different product categories and samples. Findings: Results showed that the presence of an ethical attribute leads to higher purchase intentions for products in a gift-giving context compared to self-purchase. Perceived quality mediates this effect. Further process evidence through moderation, including resource synergy beliefs, support the findings. This paper discusses the theoretical, managerial and societal implications of these results. Research limitations/implications: Although care was taken to select products to enhance generalizability, the studies presented here are limited to two products. Further, although the present research includes a field study with actual charity-related purchases, the role of time pressures is not explicitly explored. Finally, the role of brand-self connections is not explored in the current research. The ability for a donor to integrate the mission of a charity into their self-perception or the potential for social normative influences to impact behaviors remains open for exploration. Practical implications: Charities are facing increasing pressures to raise sustainable funds to support their missions. The research provides guidance to marketers and fundraisers in the non-profit sector that allows them to direct more focused fundraising appeals to donors and adapt their fundraising efforts to create a fit between their audience and fundraising appeals. Originality/value: This research demonstrates that consumption target (purchasing for the self versus purchasing for others) is a vital contextual factor that influences customer preference for ethical attributes. These results complement the extant literature by exploring the underlying mechanism behind consumers’ responses to the ethical attributes in the case of self-purchase and other-purchase. The underlying effect is supported theoretically by resource synergy beliefs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

van Doorn J.; Risselada H.; Rizio S.M.; Ye M.	DRRY_2024	(Un)intended spillovers of green government policies: The case of plastic regulations	Field Survey	Yes	2024	Governments enact various regulations to decrease the use of plastic. This raises the question of whether the effectiveness of such measures is restricted to the realm of the plastic products being regulated, or whether and how it ‘spills over’ on to the use of other plastic products. Leveraging scanner and survey data across 22 countries, the authors show that a ban or a charge on plastic bags strengthens descriptive social norms to avoid plastic, which in turn curbs the purchasing and use of plastic bottles, as well as of other plastics. Yet there is also a dark side to charging consumers for plastic bags, as a negative cueing effect can lower concerns about plastic pollution and make consumers less vigilant about their use of other plastic products. Taken together, this research shows that government regulation aimed at changing small common behaviors potentially has a much larger impact via spillover effects. © The Author(s) 2024.

Van Doorn J.; Verhoef P.C.	DV_2011	Willingness to pay for organic products: Differences between virtue and vice foods	Experiments	Yes	2011	Faced with growing environmental problems, food safety issues, and increasing obesity rates, many consumers desire healthier, less processed natural foods that are less harmful to the environment. Yet organic foods only partially benefit from this market environment, and their market share remains quite low despite high growth rates. The usual explanation for this discrepancy is that consumers are not willing to pay the price premium prompted by an organic claim. In this paper, we explore the reasons behind consumers' (un)willingness to pay for organic food and investigate whether it differs between virtue and vice food categories. The results indicate that in vice food categories, organic claims are associated with lower quality, which seems to be only partly compensated by higher prosocial benefits. The lower-quality perceptions translate into a decreased consumer willingness to pay (WTP). We supplement the empirical results with data on organic purchases in the Dutch food market. These data show that market shares of organic food are indeed lower for vice categories of organic food. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

With scanner data that track actual purchase behavior in 28 product categories, the authors find that organic products are less popular in vice categories and categories with high promotional intensity and more popular in fresh versus processed categories. Biospheric values that reflect a person's concern for the environment and animal welfare increase organic purchases. Quality and health motives drive organic purchases only in certain categories, in particular categories with a low promotional intensity.

Do K.T.; Wang C.-Y.; Guchait P.	DWG_2021	When normative framing saves Mr. Nature: Role of consumer efficacy in proenvironmental adoption	Experiments	Yes	2021	This study examines the proenvironmental persuasion of the so-called normative framing that incorporates normative influence (i.e., social norms) into message framing (i.e., loss vs. gain). Across three green contexts (i.e., towel reuse, paperless adoption, and ugly food consumption), this study shows that normative gain is consistently more effective than both normative loss and pure normative influence in promoting proenvironmental act, which is particularly motivated by positively framed information under the prospect-theoretic reasoning. This superior effect of normative gain is explained by the psychological sequence from collective efficacy to self-efficacy as the serial underlying mechanism. This study further unveils the boundary condition of anthropomorphism in amplifying this superiority (i.e., Mr. Nature, happy earth face) and reveals that the advantageous effect of normative gain is stronger among those low in interdependent self-construal.

Du S.; Yu K.; Bhattacharya C.B.; Sen S.	DYBS_2017	The business case for sustainability reporting: Evidence from stock market reactions	Field Survey	Yes	2017	Public policy makers seek to enhance disclosure of firms' sustainability performance, yet firms debate about whether, or to what extent, they should engage in sustainability reporting. This article seeks to advance current understanding about the business returns to sustainability reporting by examining the short- and long-term investor reactions. Through an event study, this research documents significant short-term stock market reaction to the release of sustainability reports. In particular, abnormal stock returns around the release of such reports are positively related to firm sustainability performance, and this positive link is smaller for firms in a strong information environment. The results show that over the long term, relative to nonreporting firms, firms that release sustainability reports enjoy higher value relevance of sustainability performance. These findings suggest that sustainability reports enhance information transparency and allow investors to incorporate sustainability information in stock valuation. This study provides strong evidence for the business case of sustainability reporting, and offers important implications for public policy makers in terms of devising policies and regulations to promote sustainability reporting. © 2017, American Marketing Association.

ED_2013	Toward Consumption Reduction: An Environmentally Motivated Perspective	Survey	Yes	2013	Faced with the threat of climate change, there is a challenge to promote more environmentally friendly consumption patterns. This work seeks to unearth psychographic and socio-demographic factors that could trigger environmentally motivated reductions in consumption. The context of empirical investigation is the European Union (i.e., a large-scale sample of European citizens), with a focus on two key types of environmentally motivated consumption reduction: domestic and "out-of-home" (purchasing) activities. The findings show the interrelated effects of environmental knowledge and ecological motivations (in both aggregated and disaggregated forms) on positive and negative environmental attitudes, which in turn influence consumption reduction. There is also evidence of significant moderating influences of perceived environmental threat, gender, age, education, and country value orientation-particularly on "environmental knowledge" links. The findings reported here contribute to theory and practice toward environmental sustainability. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Evers U.; Gruner R.L.; Sneddon J.; Lee J.A.	EGSL_2018	Exploring materialism and frugality in determining product end-use consumption behaviors	Survey	Yes	2018	Materialism is often blamed for consumers’ unsustainable consumption behaviors and its contribution to a growing “throwaway culture.” Conversely, frugal consumers are regarded as both restrained in their acquisition, and resourceful in their use and disposal of products. In this paper, the authors challenge and empirically test these prevailing beliefs. The authors focus on a much-neglected aspect of the consumption continuum: the disposal of products at the end-use of consumption, and how key consumer traits (i.e., materialism and frugality) influence behaviors at this stage. Specifically, the authors examined three creative end-use consumption behaviors with a sample of 398 US consumers. Results support the counter-intuitive notion that materialism, alongside frugality, has a positive impact on consumers’ sustainable consumption behaviors. The data suggest that materialistic consumers are prone to finding new and different uses for products and alternative methods of product disposal. The study’s results also support the notion that frugality interacts with materialism to increase intentions to find alternative methods of product disposal. The authors discuss the implications pertaining to their findings and pave the way for future research in sustainable consumption. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The role of desire for unique products, culture, and brand self-congruence	Experiments	Yes	2021	This study examines the effect of value-expressive and social-adjustive luxury attitudes on sustainable behaviors, specifically ecologically conscious consumer behavior, and socially responsible consumer behavior. This study investigates the mediating effect of the desire for unique products on the relationship between value-expressive and social-adjustive attitudes and sustainable behaviors. The moderating roles of brand self-congruence and the cultural values of collectivism and masculinity on these relationships are also explored. The results offer support for the mediating role of the desire for unique products. Furthermore, the connection between the desire for unique products and ecologically conscious consumer behavior (but not socially responsible consumer behavior) is enhanced with the moderating cultural value of collectivism and the connection between the desire for unique products and socially responsible consumer behavior (but not ecologically conscious consumer behavior) is enhanced by the moderating factor of brand self-congruence. The findings help to explain the conflicting findings regarding luxury and sustainability. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC	Psychology and Marketing	10.1002/mar.21546	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85111898620&doi=10.1002%2fmar.21546&partnerID=40&md5=6ce4d5261e1412bd1d37a4369e48c181
Ek Styvén M.; Mariani M.M.	EM_2020	Understanding the intention to buy secondhand clothing on sharing economy platforms: The influence of sustainability, distance from the consumption system, and economic motivations	Survey	Yes	2020	Sharing economy (SE) platforms are increasingly providing an effective means of connecting providers and users of secondhand goods. While media seem to emphasize that the trend of selling/buying secondhand has been growing due to the consolidation and development of peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing platforms, a comprehensive identification of the antecedents of buying secondhand on SE platforms is virtually missing. This study addresses this gap by (a) identifying different sets of motivations and attitudes leading consumers to adopt SE platforms for secondhand buying and (b) testing a model on a sample of UK consumers in the context of P2P sharing platforms for secondhand clothing. This study reveals that there are three major antecedents of consumers' attitude towards buying secondhand clothes on P2P–SE platforms: perceived sustainability, economic motivations, and taking a distance from the consumption system. Perceived sustainability and economic motivations influence positively attitude toward buying secondhand, as well as motivations in the form of distance from the consumption system. Attitude toward buying secondhand is positively influenced also by distance from the system and, in turn, has a strong positive influence on behavioral intention to buy secondhand clothes. Moreover, past experience of buying secondhand online has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between perceived sustainability and distance from the consumption system. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Elmor L.; Ramos G.A.; Vieites Y.; Andretti B.; Andrade E.B.	ERVAA_2024	Environmental sustainability considerations (or lack thereof) in consumer decision making	Experiments	Yes	2024	Environmental sustainability is often depicted as an important attribute of consideration among consumers. Even if multiple barriers may prevent them from “walking the talk,” a common implicit assumption is that consumers think about sustainability but choose a less eco-friendly route once confronted with such obstacles (e.g., higher prices). Absent from the literature, however, is a systematic investigation of the extent to which sustainability thoughts even come to consumers’ minds. Across six studies using a diverse set of measurements (free and aided elicitation), time of purchase (past or contemporaneous), consumer contexts (online or brick-and-mortar settings), levels of consequentialism (hypothetical or incentive-compatible), and samples (Brazil, UK, and US; N=7,942), our research consistently demonstrates that most consumers neglect the products’ environmental impact when making purchase decisions of fast-moving consumer goods. Environmental sustainability considerations are low in absolute terms, relative to other attributes, and even compared to participants’ own injunctive norms. Cognitive accessibility and contextual salience help explain the phenomenon. Considerations increase among consumers with strong environmental goals (e.g., high on biospheric values), for products highly prototypical of the sustainability cause (e.g., plastic bags), and when consumers are prompted with sustainability cues prior to choice (e.g., eco-labels). Methodological, managerial, and policy implications are discussed, and a simple framework to promote environmental sustainability consideration is proposed. © 2024 The Authors	International Journal of Research in Marketing	10.1016/j.ijresmar.2024.08.003	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202472614&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijresmar.2024.08.003&partnerID=40&md5=db6b78c61e82748f56d4ef8ae4224d88

The Role of Appeal Type in Consumer Responses to Sustainable Products	Experiments	Yes	2018	In the face of the growing prevalence of multiple appeals to sustainable consumption in marketers’ sustainable product communications, we examine the efficacy, in terms of consumer reactions, of adding an extrinsic appeal (e.g., “Purchase this green product to save money!”) to an intrinsic appeal (e.g., “Purchase this green product to save the environment!”) based communication for a sustainable product. Three studies provide support for our basic assertion that, compared to an intrinsic appeal, joint appeals (i.e., an intrinsic and extrinsic appeal together) reduce consumer preference for sustainable products. As well, these studies demonstrate that this adverse effect of joint appeals is based on a lowering of consumers’ attributions of the company's sustainability efforts to intrinsic motives (e.g., to the company's genuine concern for the environment). Finally, not all consumers react adversely to joint appeals; relative to intrinsic appeals, such appeals increase, rather than decrease, the intrinsic attributions and sustainable product preferences for consumers with lower involvement with sustainable consumption. © 2018 Society for Consumer Psychology	Journal of Consumer Psychology	10.1002/jcpy.1032	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054195630&doi=10.1002%2fjcpy.1032&partnerID=40&md5=8c78d531686124fe2168af4f58eb08e2
Farmer A.; Breazeale M.; Stevens J.L.; Waites S.F.	FBSW_2017	Eat green, get lean: Promoting sustainability reduces consumption	Experiments	Yes	2017	Food overconsumption contributes greatly to health problems that affect a large portion of the population while also straining the earth's natural resources. Attempts by policy makers to encourage sustainable food practices often focus more on the role of producers and less on the role of consumers, even though a growing number of consumers are concerned about the sustainability of their food products. Yet consumers often fail to perceive any immediate, personal benefits from consuming sustainably; instead, they envision future societal-level benefits. Three studies capturing actual behavior-the consumption of food and beverages-provide evidence that food promoted as sustainable can produce individual consumer benefits through reduced consumption. Study 1 shows the effect ofsustainability in lessening consumption. Study 2 demonstrates how sustainability semantically primes a prosocial focus, which is the mechanism involved in the reduction of consumption. Study 3 then shows that this effect is enhanced for people with higher levels of self-control. © 2017, American Marketing Association.

FLE_2018	Blinds up or down?: The influence of transparency, future orientation, and CSR on sustainable and responsible behavior	Experiments	Yes	2018	Purpose: This paper aims to explore how and when a business’ transparency leads to greater willingness to engage in sustainable and responsible consumption by consumers. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected in two studies. Study 1 collected data from 219 consumers in a large shopping mall. Study 2 followed an experimental approach and used data from 327 participants. Findings: The current research contributes to theory by hypothesizing and demonstrating when transparency is associated with higher willingness for sustainable and responsible consumption. Critically, the positive benefits of transparency vary according to a business’ future orientation, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and levels of customer involvement. Practical implications: An important societal and practical implication of the current research is that business should not be expected to only focus on transparency in isolation but rather also needs to consider levels of perceived future orientation, CSR and levels of customer involvement to strengthen sustainable and responsible behavior effectively. Originality/value: This research builds on and extends current knowledge by exploring the key role of business’ transparency in influencing sustainable and responsible customer behavior and examines critical boundary conditions for the observed effects. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Furchheim P.; Martin C.; Morhart F.	FMM_2020	Being green in a materialistic world: Consequences for subjective well-being	Experiments	Yes	2020	This paper explores the potential negative side-effects of the sustainability movement in societies with large segments of materialistic consumers. Across three studies, there is evidence that a conflict between materialistic and green value profiles can arise in consumers. When it arises, it seems to be related to diminished well-being. Study 1 shows that consumers with a higher value conflict (VC) experienced higher levels of stress. Consumers with higher degrees of stress then reported lower satisfaction with life. Study 2 reveals the underlying process by which this value conflict affects well-being. The results suggest that the value conflict is related to a reduced clarity of consumers’ self-concept (SCC), which in turn is related to increased levels of stress and a lower satisfaction with life. Results of Study 3 show that preference for consistency (PfC) serves as a boundary condition to this effect. The negative effect of VC on SCC is most pronounced among consumers high in PfC, while low PfC consumers seem to suffer less from the negative consequences of a conflict between green and materialistic values. Conceptual and public-policy implications of these results are discussed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Gonzales G.E.; Berry C.; Meng M.D.; Leary R.B.	GBML_2023	Identifying and Addressing the “Health Halo” Surrounding Plant-Based Meat Alternatives in Limited-Information Environments	Experiments	Yes	2023	In limited-information environments like restaurants, consumers are forced to make health inferences by drawing from the menu or promotional materials or by using their intuition. Understanding such health inferences related to plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs), which are available at a rapidly growing number of restaurants, is increasingly important. In addition to their clear environmental benefits, PBMAs are widely promoted as being healthier than traditional meat. Across five experiments, results illustrate that although some perceptions of PBMAs are aligned with reality (e.g., environmental friendliness), consumers greatly underestimate calories and nutrition (e.g., fat, sodium) relative to objective values. Additionally, consumers believe PBMAs are substantially healthier than, and decrease disease risk relative to, traditional meat, which is not always true. The currently accepted interventions of calorie labeling and nutrition information disclosure are not enough to attenuate this “health halo.” However, ensuring that consumers actively compare menu items realigns perceptions with reality. The health halo resulting from inferences formed with the limited information available at the point of purchase has numerous implications for public health, sustainable consumerism, and public policy decisions. © American Marketing Association 2023.

Gabel S.; Molitor D.; Spann M.	GMS_2024	Frontiers: The Effect of an Ad Ban on Retailer Sales: Insights from a Natural Experiment	Field Study	Yes	2024	Advertising bans typically target products that deceive consumers in ways that can threaten their physical and mental health. An alternative policy objective might seek environmental protection through a ban on print advertising. Such measures would profoundly affect grocery retailers relying on printed leaflets to communicate weekly promotions. We measure the causal effect of banning advertising on retail performance by studying a temporary advertising ban implemented in a German federal state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban resulted in the suspension of all print advertising by grocery retailers, and the exogenous variation in advertising created by this natural experiment serves as our identification strategy. We apply difference-in-differences regressions to data from a national grocery retailer and find that the ban resulted in a 6% sales decrease in the treated state compared with an adjacent state. GfK Household Panel data reveal no effect of the advertising ban on the market level but a negative impact on retailers offering and advertising weekly promotional product assortments. We study the sensitivity of these results to the COVID pandemic and find that neither changes in COVID-19 incidence, vaccination rates, nor customers’ mobility moderate the ad ban effect. The findings offer practical insights for regulators and retailers regarding the impact of ad bans and the value of advertising. © 2024 The Author(s).

GSAC_2013	Against the Green: A Multi-method Examination of the Barriers to Green Consumption	Mixed Methods	Yes	2013	Knowledge regarding the barriers to green consumption is of increasing importance as retail organizations place greater emphasis on the environment in evaluating performance in adherence with the triple-bottom line approach. The objective of this research is to investigate individual barriers that affect consumers' evaluations of the green products found in retail outlets. The research presented utilizes a critical incident qualitative study and two quantitative studies to examine the factors associated with non-green purchase behaviors. In addition, findings from an experiment suggest that altering the number and form of informational product cues may overcome purchase barriers. These factors are discussed, as are the implications of the research for stakeholders of retail organizations. © 2012 .

Gijsenberg M.J.; Verhoef P.C.	GV_2019	Moving Forward: The Role of Marketing in Fostering Public Transport Usage	Field Survey	Yes	2019	To reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, public policy makers often try to stimulate the use of public transport, as it is a more sustainable alternative to traveling by car. This study therefore investigates the impact of firm-initiated marketing actions and traveler satisfaction on monthly cumulative traveled distance of a Western European railway firm, as well as possible effects of this cumulative traveled distance on satisfaction. Analysis of time-series data on traveled distance, advertising, promotions, and satisfaction using a vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables that accounts for seasonality, trending behavior, and gasoline prices reveals positive effects of advertising and promotions. Advertising elasticities are considerably smaller than meta-analytic values of brand-advertising elasticities. Similarly, promotion elasticities are lower than those frequently reported in marketing. The authors find no effect of satisfaction on traveled distance; however, they do find a negative effect of traveled distance on satisfaction, which could be explained by capacity constraints. The authors conclude that firm-initiated marketing actions are useful and effective in fostering public transport usage. © American Marketing Association 2019.

Goedertier F.; Weijters B.; Van den Bergh J.; Schacht O.	GWBS_2024	What does sustainability mean in the minds of consumers? A multi-country panel study	Survey	Yes	2024	In developed countries, sustainability is increasingly an active agenda topic for businesses. Yet a view on what sustainability exactly means in the minds of consumers is missing. In response to this research opportunity, online panel respondents from seven advanced economies (France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, N = 5620) were surveyed in two cross-sectional waves. Factor analytical results show that consumers associate sustainability with three key subdimensions: ‘social equality’ (e.g., fair wages), ‘circularity’ (e.g., recycling) and ‘naturalness’ (e.g., avoiding use of pesticides and GMOs). This observation offers inspiration to update the traditional two-dimensional (social vs. environmental) structure of sustainability advanced in previous literature. In addition, the identified ‘naturalness’ dimension may point to a new route to stimulate pro-environmental behavior as it has both a strong link with the environment and may introduce an affective undertone. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications, and report observed country, gender, and age differences. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

Hinnosaar M.	H_2023	The Persistence of Healthy Behaviors in Food Purchasing	Field Study	Yes	2023	When a policy gives temporary incentives for healthy behaviors, how long does the impact last? The U.S. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children gives food vouchers to young children and their mothers. Using household-level scanner data, I study the reform of the program that introduced vouchers for healthier products. The difference-in-differences analysis shows that the reform makes purchases healthier during the program participation in the product categories most targeted by the reform (bread and milk). However, the effect is not always persistent. For bread, the effect decreases significantly within a couple of years after participants exit the program. Demand model estimates imply that price differences between healthy and unhealthy products play a large role in decreasing the program’s impact. Therefore, some differences in the persistence can be explained by the relatively higher prices of healthy foods. Coun-terfactual analysis shows that a modest postprogram subsidy might be a sustainable way to lengthen the program’s impact and lead to long-term healthier purchases. © 2022 INFORMS.

Hussain K.; Junaid M.; Javed M.; Ali M.; Iqbal A.	HJJAI_2022	Consumer wisdom: a mindful connection between healthy food advertising and obesity prevention	Survey	Yes	2022	Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effect of healthy food advertising (HFA) in preventing obesity (measured using the healthy eating attitude and perceived self-regulatory success) through the meta-cognitive role of consumer wisdom (CW). The meta-cognitive role of CW to better promote healthy eating attitude and behavior is relevant and underexplored. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 310 young consumers through an online survey. Reliability and validity were established using confirmatory factor analysis, and hypotheses were analyzed through structural equation modeling using MPlus V8.3. Findings: The results reveal that HFA has a positive influence on all dimensions of CW: responsibility, purpose, perspective, reasoning and sustainability. All dimensions but one augment a positive healthy eating attitude, but only responsibility and sustainability enhance consumers’ self-regulatory success. The findings show that HFA does not directly prevent obesity, but CW mediates the relationship between that advertising and obesity prevention. These findings show that CW establishes a mindful connection between HFA and obesity control. Research limitations/implications: This research extends the theory of CW in the context of healthful eating and contributes significantly to the advertising, hospitality and obesity literature. Practical implications: This study also has implications for multiple stakeholders, including consumers, restaurant operators, hospitality managers, brand managers, the government and society in general. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study marks the first attempt to investigate the role of CW in preventing obesity. It is also the first study to examine the relationships of HFA with CW and a healthful attitude toward eating. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

HKRWJ_2016	Making SENS: exploring the antecedents and impact of store environmental stewardship climate	Field Survey	Yes	2016	Retailers increasingly recognize that environmental responsibility is a strategic imperative. However, little research has investigated or identified the factors that facilitate the successful implementation of environmentally responsible strategies across a network of customer-facing sales units (stores). We propose that a store manager’s ability to lead by example facilitates this process by fostering a supportive climate for store environmental stewardship (SENS-climate). By examining the influence of store managers’ actions on sales associates’ perceptions of the SENS-climate, as well as the subsequent impact on their performance—measured by margins, as well as sales of green and regular products—this study demonstrates that store managers can foster a SENS-climate by articulating their prioritization of environmental responsibility in their operational decisions. These positive effects are sustained by relational factors, such as the moderating effect of the store manager–sales associate dyadic tenure. In contrast, when store managers display high variability in their environmental orientation, it hinders the development of SENS-climate perceptions among sales associates. If sales associates perceive an enabling SENS-climate, they achieve higher margins and more green but fewer regular sales. © 2015, The Author(s).

Consumers adopt a prosocial ambassador role when they personally commit to engage in a prosocial behavior and interpersonally promote (i.e., encourage another person to engage in) the prosocial behavior. Four experiments, including two studies in the field, investigate prosocial ambassadorship behaviors and their impact on the ambassadors’ subsequent prosocial behavior. Results reveal that the ambassador role activates a collective identity, which drives prosocial behavior. Findings also indicate that the ambassador effect endures over time. Furthermore, the ambassador effect replicates via product giveaways and communications (e.g., text messages). This research offers novel implications for marketers on the ambassador role's positive impact on prosociality, providing guidance to firms on how to leverage the ambassador effect in the marketplace. © American Marketing Association 2024.

HNKRJK_2021	Social entrepreneurship orientation: Drivers of success for start-ups and established industrial firms	Field Survey	Yes	2021	Academic research into social entrepreneurship orientation (SEO) remains nascent, despite social entrepreneurship receiving increasing attention in both research and practice. This study of 308 industrial industry firms from Austria and Northern Macedonia contributes to closing these research gaps by investigating how SEO influences social entrepreneurial performance taking into account the performance consequences of heterogeneity in firms' characteristics demonstrated by start-ups and established firms using multi-group structural equation modeling and fsQCA as methods of comparison. Combining person-centered and variable-centered methods, this study contributes by exploring how SEO influences social entrepreneurial performance and considering firms' characteristics for both start-ups and established industrial firms. The study highlights key differences for start-ups and established firms. The development phase of a firm, thus, plays a key role when examining SEO dimensions. This study informs practices of individuals seeking to undertake a business start-up or owner/managers involved in the operation and management of established firms in a social entrepreneurship context. The findings will be of interest to the enterprise support community in tailoring funding and training support for social enterprises for both start-ups and established firms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

He C.; Ozturk O.C.; Gu C.; Silva-Risso J.M.	HOGS_2021	The end of the express road for hybrid vehicles: Can governments’ green product incentives backfire?	Field Survey	Yes	2021	In response to growing environmental concerns, governments have promoted products that are less harmful to the environment—green products—through various incentives. We empirically study the impact of a commonly used nonmonetary incentive— namely, the single-occupancy permission to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes—on green and non-green product demand in the U.S. automobile industry. The HOV incentive could increase unit sales of green vehicles by enhancing their functional value through time saving. On the other hand, the incentive may prove counterproductive if it reduces the symbolic value (i.e., signaling a proenvironmental image) consumers derive from green vehicles. Assessing the effectiveness of green-product incentives is challenging, given the endogenous nature of governments’ incentive provisions. To identify the effect of the HOV incentive on unit sales of green and non-green vehicles, we take advantage of HOV-incentive changes in two states, and we employ a multitude of quasi-experimental methods using a data set at the county–model–month level. Unlike previous studies that only examine the launch of the HOV incentive and find an insignificant association be-tween incentive launch and green-vehicle demand, we concentrate on its termination. We find that the termination of the HOV incentive decreases unit sales of vehicles covered by the incentive by 14.4%. We provide suggestive evidence that this significant negative effect of HOV-incentive termination is due to the elimination of the functional value the incentive provides: time saving. Specifically, we find that the negative effect is more pronounced in counties where consumers value time saving more (i.e., counties with a longer commute to work and higher income). Additionally, in line with prior literature, the launch of the HOV incentive is not found to have a significant effect on green-vehicle sales. Combined, our findings reveal that the effect of termination is not simply the opposite of that of launch, implying that governments’ green-product incentives could backfire. © 2020 INFORMS.

Huang B.; Suri A.; Tezer A.; Sénécal S.	HSTS_2024	This is not mine anymore: The dark side of collaborative consumption	Experiments	Yes	2024	Extant research on collaborative consumption in the sharing economy generally focuses on consumers (those who consume such services) while overlooking an important actor: the peer service providers (those who provide these services by sharing their resources with other consumers). Through four studies, we show a potential detrimental side effect of collaborative consumption. Specifically, our results suggest that for peer service providers, sharing their assets leads to a greater perceived loss of psychological ownership of these assets. This phenomenon thus results in a potentially unsustainable outcome: faster disposal of the shared assets. The authors further show that this effect disappears when the asset is shared with in-group (vs. out-group) members. Lastly, the authors offer a practical and easily implementable solution that could avert this potentially detrimental phenomenon: To encourage service providers to personalize their assets, which restores their perceived psychological ownership. Together, these results advance the literature on the dark side of collaborative consumption and offer managerial insights into mitigating strategies. © 2024 The Author(s)	International Journal of Research in Marketing	10.1016/j.ijresmar.2024.05.002	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195303771&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijresmar.2024.05.002&partnerID=40&md5=691ed6558660f5469ead61c3e63205b4
Huang F.; Wong V.C.	HW_2024	From Second-Hand to Third-Hand: Reuse and Resale Cycle	Experiments	Yes	2024	The promotion of reuse and resale has been receiving extensive attention worldwide for the sake of sustainability. The current research provides insights into this area and identifies a “reuse and resale cycle,” whereby consumers are more willing to resell products they originally obtained second hand, compared to products they obtained brand new. One potential mechanism that accounts for this effect is the relatively weak connection consumers form with the second-hand items they own. Six studies confirmed this effect across various product categories. Study 1 tracked consumers’ actual resale of the possessions they owned in real life. Subsequent studies provided further empirical evidence for the proposed effect, uncovered the underlying mechanism concerning the strength of the connection with the product, and showed that the effect diminished among consumers who chronically have a high tendency to link themselves with their possessions. This research advances the understanding of resale behaviors. It has implications for consumers to avoid retaining excessive possessions and for the second-hand market to develop in a healthy manner, eventually contributing to society’s sustainability in the long run. © The Author(s) 2024.

Inigo E.A.; Ritala P.; Albareda L.	IRA_2020	Networking for sustainability: Alliance capabilities and sustainability-oriented innovation	Field Survey	Yes	2020	Research on open innovation and sustainability suggests that alliances with external stakeholders help to improve innovation outcomes. This paper taps into the intersection of these literatures and investigates how alliance proactiveness and alliance portfolio coordination affect firms' sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) outcomes. Data were collected from 170 firms in the Basque Country region in Spain, which has a highly collaborative regional innovation system. Partial least squares (PLS) modeling confirmed that alliance proactiveness is positively related to radical SOI, while alliance portfolio coordination is positively related to incremental SOI. In addition, these two capabilities involve a positive interaction effect in the case of radical SOI. An additional set of post hoc tests using latent class analysis (FIMIX-PLS) provided further evidence that firms with different internal features and levels of environmental turbulence benefit to varying extents from these capabilities and their interactions. Overall, the findings of this study show the benefits of the coupled mode of open innovation and alliance capabilities in reaching positive outcomes in SOI. On the one hand, companies focusing on incremental SOI can reap greater benefits from open innovation when collaborating within their existing portfolio; while for radical SOI, alliance proactiveness is beneficial for finding disruptive partners. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Juan Y.-K.; Hsu Y.-H.; Xie X.	JHX_2017	Identifying customer behavioral factors and price premiums of green building purchasing	Experiments	Yes	2017	In recent years, global urbanization and overdevelopment have resulted in environmental degradation and an energy crisis. Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed. The proposed model can be applied as an effective decision-support tool for green building pricing and formulating marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Across three studies, this research investigates the role of three representations of God: (1) God as an authoritarian personified being, (2) God as a benevolent personified being, and (3) God as a mystical cosmic force. The results of Study 1 suggest that attitude toward nature mediates the relationship between these representations of God and three sustainability behaviors. Similarly, the results of Study 2 suggest that attitude tdward nature mediates the relationship between these representations of God and the importance of proenvironmental policies. In addition, the authors find self-transcendence to be an antecedent of belief in a mystical representation of God. Study 3 includes awe as an antecedent of self-transcendence and generally replicates the findings from Study 2 regarding the role of the representations of God in people's cognitive processing of their willingness to vote for proenvironmental policies. © 2017, American Marketing Association.

However, research on reorientation of existing industries, and value networks in that situation, has been limited. This study examines the changes to existing industry value networks that can facilitate the diffusion of sustainable innovation in food packaging. Empirically, the transformation and distribution of agro-food waste into a new bioplastic packaging through the existing food packaging value network is investigated. As a result, the changes to the existing value network and their connections, facilitating the diffusion of the sustainable innovation, are identified at three levels – firm, network, and macro. The findings show the importance of opportunity recognition, but also the role of new actors, resources, activities, and relationships in the restructuring of the existing value network and actions creating supportive regulative framework and increasing market demand for such renewal. This creates understanding of how the adoption of sustainable innovations, such as new packaging materials, which might seem simple, is complicated by the broad changes required from the existing value network. © 2020 The Authors	Industrial Marketing Management	10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.10.011	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096381671&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2020.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=770ad52bc4c3e353d3f9e143cb0db527

KL_2022	Mindfulness enhances the values that promote sustainable consumption	Experiments	Yes	2022	Prior research has demonstrated the critical role of values in promoting sustainable consumption behaviors. However, research is needed to identify novel ways to influence these values so that consumers will act on them. The present research demonstrates a practical and underappreciated way to enhance the values that promote sustainable consumption behaviors. Specifically, we demonstrate that mindfulness has a positive relationship with biospheric and altruistic values (but not egoistic values), and that these values mediate the relationship between mindfulness and two distinct forms of sustainable consumption: socially conscious consumption and frugal (i.e., reduced) consumption. We employ a series of three studies with sample populations drawn from different countries, and we use multiple measures for each of our focal constructs to demonstrate the robustness of our findings. Our findings suggest that marketers and policy makers can integrate mindfulness into their promotion and education initiatives as a means to help consumers clarify their values and, thereby, increase levels of sustainable consumption. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Karman A.; Lipowski M.	KL_2024	Switching to sustainable products: The role of time, product, and customer characteristics	Experiments	Yes	2024	Achieving a sustainable economy is one of the primary needs of our time, and sustainable products can play a decisive role in achieving this goal. This article seeks answers about the role of time and product characteristics in the intention to switch to a sustainable product using the example of an everyday product. Drawing from social identity theory, utility maximization and switching theory, the authors propose a conceptual model to examine these questions in a specific market disruption when a product is modified by the same company. The framework focuses on the time-varying effects of customers' features (brand identification, loyalty, embeddedness) and products' features (perceived value [PV], compliance, switching cost) on switching behavior. The research was carried out using a quasi-experimental method in three periods. In the first stage, Cox Proportional Hazard Regression was used, and a random-effects model in the second. Results from longitudinal data of 282 customers during the launch of a new sustainable product show that customer characteristics do not influence the intention to switch. In contrast, the PV and switching costs inhibit the switching behavior, but their effects vary over time. In particular, the effect of the relative PV of the sustainable product on switching will increase over time, but the importance of customer–brand identification also rises. The study has important implications for introducing a sustainable equivalent of an incumbent product of the same brand. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This study develops a model that integrates effectiveness-enhancing outcomes and organizational inputs of eco-friendly product development strategies. Using questionnaire responses from firms from multiple industries, supplemented with lagged primary product development performance data, we find that top management commitment and corporate environmental support policies can facilitate eco-friendly product development strategies, while environmental performance incentives do not. In turn, the adoption of such strategies has a positive effect on firms’ product development effectiveness. This effect weakens when business conditions are highly complex but tends to become stronger with increasing levels of munificence in the business environment. These findings have important implications for practitioners and researchers that are discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).

KND_2018	The Ecological Impact of Anticonsumption Lifestyles and Environmental Concern	Survey	Yes	2018	Unsustainable consumption is an important cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment. The authors compare the ecological impact of anticonsumption lifestyles and environmental concern. Findings indicate that high scores on anticonsumption lifestyles (voluntary simplicity, frugality, and tightwadism) and environmental concern are associated with lower ecological impact. More precisely, the findings show that these lifestyles are not associated with a reduction in consumption, as their stereotypes would imply. Voluntary simplicity (β = −.286) and tightwadism (β = −.216) show a stronger association with lower ecological impact (i.e., are less harmful to the environment) than environmental concern (β = −.190), whereas frugality (β = −.089) is not associated with reduced impact after demographic variables were controlled for. The findings pertaining to voluntary simplicity and tightwadism suggest that resisting consumption is an alternative path toward more sustainable consumption. Public policy makers and marketers can build on these findings and include reduced consumption and sufficiency in their sustainability strategies. © American Marketing Association 2018.

Kuanr A.; Pradhan D.; Chaudhuri H.R.	KPC_2020	I (do not) consume; therefore, I am: Investigating materialism and voluntary simplicity through a moderated mediation model	Experiments	Yes	2020	With the burgeoning of consumer culture and materialism on a global scale, a counter-culture movement, namely, voluntary simplicity, is slowly gaining currency. Extant research reveals a degree of disparateness in the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity. Drawing on the value-basis theory and anti-consumption research, the current study attempts at an unorthodox study of the fledgling culture of anti-consumption in urban India. The paper empirically examines the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity in India. This research, through an experimental study followed by a sample survey, conducted among urban Indian consumers, examines how satisfaction with life, self-efficacy, and individualism interact with materialistic values to eventually influence voluntary simplicity attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 74 working professionals), we experimentally triggered materialistic aspirations and evaluated their effects on voluntary simplicity in comparison to a control condition. In Study 2 (N = 315), individuals self-rated their materialistic values, satisfaction with life, self-efficacy, cultural orientation, and voluntary simplicity attitude. Our study, contrary to the suggestions in the existing literature, demonstrates that materialists espouse voluntary simplicity attitudes when environmental degradation around them directly impacts their health, wealth, and well-being. In addition to the positive direct effect, satisfaction with life and self-efficacy serially mediate the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity, providing a welcome divergence from dark-sided conceptualizations of materialism. Our results help global marketers, and public policymakers better understand the interaction between materialistic values and sustainable consumption attitudes, in the developing country perspective. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Kim J.; Park J.; Septianto F.	KPS_2022	The impact of socioeconomic status on preferences for sustainable luxury brands	Experiments	Yes	2022	As consumers become more aware of and concerned about the environmental impact of their consumption choices, an increasing number of luxury brands are now engaging in sustainability practices. This study examines factors influencing the effectiveness of embedding sustainability in luxury brands. Specifically, the research focus is the effect of childhood socioeconomic status on moderating consumer preferences for sustainable (vs. regular, nonsustainable) luxury brands. Four experimental studies using different product categories and luxury brands show that preferences for sustainable (vs. regular, nonsustainable) luxury brands are stronger among consumers with relatively low (vs. high) childhood socioeconomic status (Studies 1–4). Notably, these preference patterns are driven by differences in the perceived importance of cooperation in the community among consumers with low versus high childhood socioeconomic status (Study 3). However, these divergent patterns are attenuated when consumption involves the nonluxury brand category (Study 2), and when consumers experience a high-threat environment (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic; Study 4). As such, the findings of this study contribute to the literature by shedding light on the conditions under which consumers show preferences for sustainable (vs. regular, nonsustainable) luxury brands, establishing a theoretically grounded mediator (importance of cooperation in the community) and moderator (perceived environmental threat). © 2022 The Authors.

Li L.	L_2022	Digital transformation and sustainable performance: The moderating role of market turbulence	Field Survey	Yes	2022	As digital technologies disrupt one sector after another, many companies are actively embracing digital transformation. However, the relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance remains unclear. To fill this gap, based on an integrated perspective of dynamic capability and organizational inertia, this study examines the curvilinear relationships between digital transformation and economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable performance. Survey data from 223 Chinese companies articulate that although digital transformation fosters economic performance at an accelerating rate, it depicts an inverse U-shaped relationship with environmental performance. More interestingly, the accelerating rate of digital transformation on economic performance is quicker under low market turbulence. In contrast, when market turbulence is high, higher digital transformation is associated with worse environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing new theoretical explanations for the inconsistent relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance. This study also assists companies in re-evaluating their digital strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Lee D.C.; Kim J.	LK_2024	Feeling younger and acting greener: The impact of subjective age on sustainable consumption	Experiments	Yes	2024	It is widely believed that younger generations are at the forefront of sustainability efforts. Given the significance of fostering greater consumer participation in sustainable consumption, this perception prompts an intriguing question: If consumers associate sustainability with younger individuals, can simply instilling a sense of youthfulness increase their engagement in sustainable consumption, regardless of their actual age? Building upon previous research on subjective age—that is, how old one feels—and consumer identity, we propose that consumers will gravitate towards sustainable products when they feel younger than older. This is because such products align well with their perceived age identity, creating a perception of fit. The findings across three studies provide converging evidence that simply making consumers feel younger can result in an increased preference for sustainable products. Study 1 demonstrated that feeling younger increased the selection of more sustainable products over less sustainable ones. Study 2 showed that this effect is mediated by the perceived fit. Study 3 further supported the underlying mechanism by revealing that the focal effect was mitigated when the association between sustainability and younger age was weakened. Study 4 replicated the focal effect in a consequential choice setting. Finally, Study 5 confirmed the proposed effect by using trait subjective age as a predictor. © 2024 The Author(s).

Lu F.-C.; Sinha J.	LS_2024	How social media usage and the fear of missing out impact minimalistic consumption	Experiments	Yes	2024	Purpose: This study aims to examine the influence of social media usage (SMU) on minimalist consumption and how the fear of missing out (FoMO) underlies this effect. Design/methodology/approach: Four preregistered correlational/experimental studies (n = 1,763) are used. A pilot study (n = 436) examines the correlations between SMU, FoMO and minimalism. Studies 1 (n = 409), 2 (n = 415) and 3 (n = 503) further investigate the influence of SMU on minimalist consumption intentions, including mindful purchase, forgoing free products and decluttering, and test for evidence of mediation via FoMO by measuring or manipulating FoMO. Findings: The results show that a high SMU makes consumers susceptible to FoMO, leading to impulsive purchases and careless product acquisition. However, when campaigners promote minimalism as a social media movement, they can activate FoMO, persuading consumers to practice decluttering. Research limitations/implications: Future research might examine how subjective age affects FoMO and minimalist consumption tendencies. Could campaigners use young social cues to make older consumers more susceptible to FoMO appeals? Could old social cues cause younger consumers to perceive greater social responsibility and to embrace minimalist consumption? Practical implications: Minimalist lifestyles can promote sustainable consumption. This research provides insights into how SMU is a double-edged sword – it can cause FoMO users to disdain minimalism. However, it can promote minimalism if a minimalist campaign is strategically positioned as a social media movement using a FoMO-laden appeal. Originality/value: Extant consumer behavior research on minimalism has just begun to investigate the antecedents of minimalist consumption. FoMO is conceptually related to minimalism, but the relationship between FoMO and minimalist consumption has not yet been empirically tested. This research fills these gaps by examining SMU and the associated FoMO as antecedents of minimalist consumption. Empirical evidence for the impact of SMU on various minimalist consumption behaviors and the mediating role of FoMO is provided. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Li Y.; Wei L.; Zeng X.; Zhu J.	LWZZ_2020	Mindfulness in ethical consumption: the mediating roles of connectedness to nature and self-control	Survey	Yes	2020	Purpose: Ethical consumption is an integral component for the sustainable development in the world and is especially challenging in the Western consumer society. This research demonstrates that mindfulness, a Buddhism-based notion, is associated with two related and distinctive approaches of ethical consumption: refinement and reduction. It examines the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness on these two approaches of ethical consumption. Design/methodology/approach: Self-report data were collected through an online survey with consumers from western societies (N = 523). Findings: The findings show (1) that the significance of mindfulness on both approaches of ethical consumption and (2) that the contrast between the different mechanisms underlying them. Specifically, the mindfulness–consumption refinement link is fully mediated by connectedness-to-nature whereas the mindfulness–consumption reduction link is fully mediated by connectedness-to-nature and self-control. A series of supplementary studies further confirmed the proposed model. Research limitations/implications: It demonstrates the multifaceted and complex nature of ethical consumption, which is positively associated with mindfulness but through distinctive psychological mechanisms. Practical implications: The multifaceted and complex nature of ethical consumption and its underlying drivers need special attention. Mindfulness can be an effective means to boost ethical consumption behavior. Meanwhile, nurturing the sense of connectedness to nature and self-control capability facilitates the path-through of the positive impacts of mindfulness Social implications: The findings can be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of mindfulness practice in promoting ethical consumption towards achieving the Sustainable Consumption goal, especially in the West. Originality/value: The paper makes original contribution by conceptualizing two interrelated and distinctive approaches of ethical consumption and shows how mindfulness promotes both through different mediating pathways. Overall, this study paints a clearer picture how mindfulness relates to ethical consumption. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Mookerjee S.; Cornil Y.; Hoegg J.	MCH_2021	From Waste to Taste: How “Ugly” Labels Can Increase Purchase of Unattractive Produce	Experiments	Yes	2021	Food producers and retailers throw away large amounts of perfectly edible produce that fails to meet appearance standards, contributing to the environmental issue of food waste. The authors examine why consumers discard aesthetically unattractive produce, and they test a low-cost, easy-to-implement solution: emphasizing the produce’s aesthetic flaw through “ugly” labeling (e.g., labeling cucumbers with cosmetic defects “Ugly Cucumbers” on store displays or advertising). Seven experiments, including two conducted in the field, demonstrate that “ugly” labeling corrects for consumers’ biased expectations regarding key attributes of unattractive produce—particularly tastiness—and thus increases purchase likelihood. “Ugly” labeling is most effective when associated with moderate (rather than steep) price discounts. Against managers’ intuition, it is also more effective than alternative labeling that does not exclusively point out the aesthetic flaw, such as “imperfect” labeling. This research provides clear managerial recommendations on the labeling and the pricing of unattractive produce while addressing the issue of food waste. © The Author(s) 2021.

Moes A.; Fransen M.; Verhagen T.; Fennis B.	MFVF_2022	A good reason to buy: Justification drives the effect of advertising frames on impulsive socially responsible buying	Experiments	Yes	2022	Today, consumers expect companies to be socially responsible. However, the literature is undecided about the effects of communicating one's corporate social responsibility activities to consumers. This raises the question of how sustainability-driven companies can best advertise their products to stimulate ethical consumption: using self-benefit frames, where the main beneficiary is the consumer, or using other-benefit frames, where the main beneficiary is a third party. Using three experiments, this study examines the effect of other-benefit (vs. self-benefit) advertising frames on consumers' impulse purchases from sustainability-driven companies. Increasing impulse purchases can help such companies to strengthen their competitive positions. Additionally, it is studied to what extent two types of justification (moral versus deservingness) explain the proposed effect of advertising frames. The results show that only other-benefit frames affect impulse buying behavior, both directly, as mediated by moral justification. This study's insights may help sustainability-driven companies to decide on their advertising strategies by providing evidence that other-benefit-framed advertisements are more effective in enhancing impulse purchases than self-benefit-framed advertisements. © 2022 The Authors.

Meng M.D.; Gamlin J.	MG_2024	Sexually explicit advertisements boost consumer recycling due to moral cleansing goal activation	Experiments	Yes	2024	Building on research showing that sexually explicit advertisements (i.e., those depicting figuratively “dirty” content) are viewed as immoral, three experiments propose and demonstrate that exposure to figuratively dirty (vs. clean) advertisements activates consumers’ moral cleansing goals, which subsequently boosts recycling-related behaviors. These effects do not arise for literally dirty (vs. clean) advertisements, helping to support a goal activation account, rather than mere semantic priming. Further, the effect of figuratively dirty (vs. clean) advertisements on recycling-related behavior is amplified for consumers higher in internalized moral identity. These findings contribute to the literatures on consumer goal activation, moral identity, and sustainability, and have practical implications for marketers considering explicit advertising campaigns and public policy makers wanting to better understand the drivers of consumer recycling. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

Meng M.D.; Leary R.B.	ML_2021	It might be ethical, but I won't buy it: Perceived contamination of, and disgust towards, clothing made from recycled plastic bottles	Experiments	Yes	2021	A popular trend within the fashion industry is to transform recycled plastic bottles into attire, though little research has examined consumer acceptance of these items. This study integrates evolutionary perspectives on contagion, contamination, and the emotion of disgust to explore consumer perception of such goods. Across three studies, this study shows that consumers view products made from used recycled plastic bottles as contaminated, decreasing purchase intentions. Further, this contamination perception is heightened among those with high disgust sensitivity. This study also shows an important boundary condition to this effect, where consumers express greater intentions to use a product made from recycled plastic bottles when it is not touching the skin (e.g., carrying bag) compared to those that are in contact with skin (e.g., T-shirt). Finally, this study shows how marketers can harness this effect by exploiting the evolutionary response to attractive others using the plastic bottles, which results in positive contamination and an increase in willingness to pay. In so doing, the current research is the first to show that highlighting the recycled nature of a product can actually serve as a contamination cue, adding to our theoretical understanding of perceived contamination and the resulting emotion of disgust. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

MRHN_2021	Reducing food waste through digital platforms: A quantification of cross-side network effects	Field Survey	Yes	2021	To fight food waste, retail stores have begun selling perishable food close to the expiration date at discounted prices. To render this form of last-minute discounting effective, digital platforms have been developed with the major aim to connect local retail stores and their consumers by sharing information about these discounts. To sustain digital platforms, platform leaders need to ensure both consumers and retail stores remain active on it. To provide platform leaders with advice on how to create a sustainable digital platform, we examine how retail store activity on the digital platform affects consumer activity, and vice versa (also known as cross-side network effects). By combining a PVAR model and an impulse response function, along with data from a digital platform aimed at food waste reduction, we find that the effect of consumer activity on retail store activity is stronger and more long-lasting than the effect of retail store activity on consumer activity. We discuss the implications of our findings for both retail stores and digital platform leaders. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Few studies have addressed the role of guilt in influencing sustainable pro-environmental behaviors among shoppers. The current study investigates two primary questions: Do male and female shoppers perceive guilt differently? Can guilt in an advertising context motivate shoppers to bring reusable grocery bags? Survey findings from Study 1 showed that high guilt was more impactful on women and helped generate favorable attitudes and behavior. The experiment for Study 2, based on the theory of psychological ownership, elicited a moderate level of guilt using advertisements related to egoistic and biospheric concerns. Findings showed that egoistic concerns, such as saving money, were more effective and that this effect was stronger for women than men.

Nickerson D.; Lowe M.; Pattabhiramaiah A.; Sorescu A.	NLPS_2022	The Impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on Brand Sales: An Accountability Perspective	Experiments	Yes	2022	Consumers are increasingly mindful of corporate social responsibility (CSR) when making purchase and consumption decisions, but evidence of the impact of CSR initiatives on actual purchase decisions is lacking. This article introduces a novel brand accountability–based framework of consumer response to CSR initiatives, which categorizes CSR efforts as “corrective,” “compensating,” or “cultivating goodwill.” Leveraging a database of CSR press releases by leading consumer packaged goods brands, the authors examine the effect of the different types of CSR announcements on brand sales. The findings suggest that CSR initiatives that genuinely aim to reduce a brand's negative externalities (“corrective” and “compensating”) lift sales, whereas CSR actions focused on philanthropy (“cultivating goodwill”) can hurt sales. The authors propose two moderators—CSR reputation and CSR focus on environmental or social causes—and a mechanism for these effects, which they examine under controlled experimental settings. The experimental results show that, conditional on CSR reputation, consumers perceive varying degrees of sincerity in the different CSR types and that sincerity mediates the effect of CSR type on purchase intentions. Overall, the results suggest that consumers are more inclined to reward firms that directly reduce the negative by-products of their own business practices than to be impressed by public goodwill gestures. © American Marketing Association 2021.

OSC_2014	Green claims and message frames: How green new products change brand attitude	Field Survey	Yes	2014	In response to a top ten global consumer trend, firms are increasingly introducing environmentally sustainable ("green") new products. Firms allocate significant resources to this area; thus, the authors consider the brand-level implications by investigating how the introduction of green new products changes attitude toward the brand. In examining this relationship, they draw from social identity and framing theories to investigate drivers of green new product introductions as well as the moderating effects of message framing, source credibility, and product type. Estimating a three-stage least squares model based on new product introductions from 75 brands across a four-year time period (2009-2012), the authors find that green new product introductions can indeed improve brand attitude and that both the brand and category's positioning influence the introduction of green new products. They also find that the quantity of green messages, the product type, and their source credibility influence the extent to which green new products change brand attitude. The authors use these findings to provide guidance for managers as they attempt to effectively link their green innovation efforts to improve consumer attitudes toward their brands. © 2014, American Marketing Association.

Paharia N.	P_2020	Who Receives Credit or Blame? The Effects of Made-to-Order Production on Responses to Unethical and Ethical Company Production Practices	Experiments	Yes	2020	While prior research has found that consumer-influenced production improves purchase intentions, the author proposes that it can counterintuitively backfire. This work demonstrates that when consumers have some control over production (e.g., ordering products on demand, customization, preordering), they have lower purchase intentions for products made with unethical processes (e.g., pollution, underpaid labor) than if they had no role in production (i.e., buying what is already in inventory). This effect reverses, however, with positive ethical production (e.g., recycled materials). Because consumers have direct responsibility for whether a product is made, feelings of anticipated guilt or gratification result depending on the ethicality of the production process. This work also proposes a novel threefold conceptualization of responsibility that can be used as managerial levers: direct responsibility, diffusion of responsibility, and broad responsibility. Field studies using Facebook’s advertising platform demonstrate positioning strategies for fair-trade brands and advocacy groups. © American Marketing Association 2019.

PBFPWKGS_2021	Startups versus incumbents in ‘green’ industry transformations: A comparative study of business model archetypes in the electrical power sector	Field Survey	Yes	2021	Scholars have recently argued that startups and incumbents play differential roles in the disruptive transformations of industries toward sustainability and that the transformations are only likely to succeed if both startups and incumbents contribute. To understand their respective contributions and, thus, to understand how industries make the transition toward sustainability, comparative studies of incumbents versus startups during this transformation have been identified as a central pursuit, but yet they are mostly lacking. Since business models have become a principal way of characterizing firms, the present study takes a business model perspective and derives business model archetypes in the electrical power sector from an analysis of 280 startups and incumbents in three different countries. The selected countries (USA, UK, and India) represent three different energy profiles and leading instances of disruption in the energy sector. The article, then, undertakes a comparative analysis of startups and incumbents based on the empirically distilled business model archetypes and develops propositions on startups, incumbents, and business models in industry transformations. This analysis produces several important insights. First, incumbents do not seem to engage in less business model experimentation than startups. Second, incumbents have adopted several new business models that are not pursued by startups. Third, startups have espoused some business models that are not pursued by incumbents. Fourth, foreign firms can also affect the ‘green’ transformation of an industry in a focal country.

PMY_2024	Why a Single Pro-Environmental Appeal Works to Promote Behavioral Change On Social Media, One Tip versus Many Is More Effective for Nongreen Consumers	Experiments	Yes	2024	Some brands, not-for-profit organizations, and social media influencers post tips to encourage prosocial behaviors. This is particularly prevalent in the context of environmental sustainability. Through a series of three studies, including a field experiment using a real brand to investigate click-through rates and cost per click, this research finds that a single green tip (versus many tips) enhances brand attitudes among consumers with low environmental concern. By contrast, the number of tips is less consequential for consumers with high environmental concern. Perceived brand authenticity is the mediating mechanism behind the effect. These findings hold across different product categories and different manipulations for the number of tips. © 2024, World Advertising Research Center. All rights reserved.

Pekovic S.; Rolland S.	PR_2016	Customer orientation and firm’s business performance: A moderated mediation model of environmental customer innovation and contextual factors	Field Survey	Yes	2016	Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a better theoretical and empirical understanding of the causal and contextual mechanisms explaining the relationship between customer orientation and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage least squares model was used on a sample of 3,720 French firms with 20 or more employees. Findings: By using a moderated mediation approach, it was found that the mediating effect of environmental customer innovation on the relationship between customer orientation and business performance under different contextual factors (market environment, firm size and sector of activity) can be significantly stronger or weaker. Research limitations/implications: This analysis is restricted by the choice of one particular country, and further research should use data from other countries to develop a general understanding of the issues examined. Additionally, examining relevant mechanisms other than firm performance measures will advance the understanding of the customer orientation–firm performance linkage. Because of the fact that the majority of variables used are binary and that each survey was conducted in a particular situation and in a particular context, the picture portrayed could be biased. Because environmental issues not only concern consumers but also all other market actors, it would be highly useful to verify the obtained results using broader concepts such as Hult’s (2011) “market orientation plus” concept or the “sustainable market orientation” developed by Mitchell et al. (2010). Practical implications: According to the results, to achieve market success and sustain a competitive advantage, managers must simultaneously invest in customer orientation and innovation performance. Additionally, managers should consider market environment, firm size and sector of activity as important contingencies in their decision of whether to invest in customer orientation. Originality/value: This study makes an important contribution by opening up a “black box” and offers a deeper perspective on how and why customer orientation affects firm performance. In particular, rather than providing separate analyses of mediating and moderating effects, this study proposes a simultaneous analysis that reveals how and under what conditions customer orientation improves business performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Pantano E.; Stylos N.	PS_2020	The Cinderella moment: Exploring consumers' motivations to engage with renting as collaborative luxury consumption mode	Field Study	Yes	2020	Past literature argued that the purchase of luxury goods is driven by people's motivation to conform or fit into our economic and social system. In this study, the authors focus on a new aspect of consumption, that is, renting instead of purchasing luxury goods, backed by the emerging opportunities of sharing economy platforms. Drawing upon the analysis of spontaneous consumers' online communications (in the form of tweets), this study aims to investigate the motivations to engage with luxury garment renting within a collaborative consumption context. To this end, a series of automatic content analyses, via two studies, were conducted using the tweets posted with respect to the Run the Runway collaborative consumption platform. Results demonstrate consumers' increased willingness to show their social status through renting rather than owning luxurious apparel based on five main motivators (need to wear new clothes for a special event, inspirations created by the products/brands, possibility to explore a new way of consuming luxury goods, need to make more sustainable choices, and to increase the life cycle of each luxury product). The implications of these findings are discussed, while they pave the way for future research in collaborative consumption of luxury retailing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Panzone L.A.; Ulph A.; Hilton D.; Gortemaker I.; Tajudeen I.A.	PUHGT_2021	Sustainable by Design: Choice Architecture and the Carbon Footprint of Grocery Shopping	Field Survey	Yes	2021	The increase in global temperatures requires substantial reductions in the greenhouse emissions from consumer choices. The authors use an experimental incentive-compatible online supermarket to analyze the effect of a carbon-based choice architecture, which presents commodities to customers in high, medium, and low carbon footprint groups, in reducing the carbon footprints of grocery baskets. The authors relate this choice architecture to two other policy interventions: (1) a bonus-malus carbon tax on all grocery products and (2) moral goal priming using an online banner noting the moral importance of reducing one’s carbon footprint. Participants shopped from their home in an online store containing 612 existing food products and 39 existing nonfood products for which the authors had carbon footprint data over three successive weeks, with the interventions occurring in the second and third weeks. Choice architecture reduced participants’ carbon footprint significantly in the third week by reducing the proportion of choices made in the high-carbon aisle. The carbon tax reduced carbon footprint in both weeks, primarily by reducing overall spend. The goal-priming banner led to a small reduction in carbon footprint in the second week only. Thus, the design of the marketplace plays an important role in achieving the policy objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © The Author(s) 2021.

RHS_2017	The Effect of Descriptive Norms and Construal Level on Consumers' Sustainable Behaviors	Experiments	Yes	2017	With the assumption that the distinctive effect of provincial norms (versus general norms) derives from a spatial distance between the actors and reference groups, the present research examined whether the effect of two types of descriptive norms on consumers' sustainable behaviors can be moderated by construal-level messages. Both a laboratory (Study 1) and field experiment (Study 2) demonstrated that provincial norms (versus general norms) are more effective in encouraging consumers to participate in a sustainability campaign when paired with low-construal-level messages; but provincial norms are no longer superior to general norms when both norms are presented with high-construal-level messages. The findings collectively indicated that the congruence between types of descriptive norms and construal level messages leads to consumers' attitudinal and behavioral changes.

Reczek R.W.; Irwin J.R.; Zane D.M.; Ehrich K.R.	RIZE_2018	That's Not How i Remember It: Willfully Ignorant Memory for Ethical Product Attribute Information	Experiments	Yes	2018	This research documents a systematic bias in memory for ethical attribute information: consumers have better memory for an ethical attribute when a product performs well on the attribute versus when a product performs poorly on the attribute. Because consumers want to avoid emotionally difficult ethical information (e.g., child labor) but believe they should remember it in order to do the right thing, the presence of negative ethical information in a choice or evaluation produces conflict between the want and should selves. Consumers resolve this conflict by letting the want self prevail and forgetting or misremembering the negative ethical information. A series of studies establishes the willfully ignorant memory effect, shows that it holds only for ethical attributes and not for other attributes, and provides process evidence that it is driven by consumers allowing the want self to prevail in order to avoid negative feelings associated with the conflict. We also ameliorate the effect by reducing the amount of pressure exerted by the should self. Lastly, we demonstrate that consumers judge forgetting negative ethical information as more morally acceptable than remembering but ignoring it, suggesting that willfully ignorant memory is a more morally acceptable form of coping with want/should conflict. © 2017 The Author.

Ramirez E.; Jiménez F.R.; Gau R.	RJG_2015	Concrete and abstract goals associated with the consumption of environmentally sustainable products	Mixed Methods	Yes	2015	Purpose – This paper aims to identify and classify consumers’ goals associated with the consumption of environmentally sustainable products. The applicability of such goals to the positioning of environmental products is also tested. Design/methodology/approach – Study 1 used 62 laddering interviews to identify a hierarchical map of adoption related goals. Study 2 used a survey design (N = 152 students) to test the effects of construal-goal fit on evaluations of environmental product attributes of a hybrid car. Study 3 involved an online experiment (N = 125 consumer panellists) to test the effects of construal-goal fit on consumers’ willingness to pay a price premium (WTPP) for energy-efficient light bulbs. Findings – A hierarchical goal map displays consumption goals attainable through environmentally sustainable products. Consumers with a chronic, high-level construal placed more importance on product attributes associated with abstract goals than those with chronic, low-level construal. This effect was stronger for males than for females. Additionally, construal-goal fit increased WTPP. Research limitations/implications – The results suggest that marketers consider construal-goal fit to communicate the value of environmentally sustainable products. The results, however, should be replicated in other product categories and across diverse cultural settings. Originality/value – This paper identifies and classifies the goals related to consumption of environmentally sustainable products. Additionally, it tests the effects of construal-goal fit on evaluations of environmental products, providing insights for marketers seeking to improve their promotional efforts and for public policymakers as they institute demarketing campaigns. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Ross G.R.; Meloy M.G.; Bolton L.E.	RMB_2021	Disorder and Downsizing	Experiments	Yes	2021	The consequences of overconsumption and the recent popularity of simple living point to consumer interest in reducing belongings. They also raise an interesting question-what is a useful approach to downsizing and decluttering? We investigate how dis/order (messy vs.Tidy items) affects downsizing and find, across nine focal studies, that (a) consumers retain fewer items when choosing from a disordered set because (b) order facilitates the comparisons within category that underlie the tendency to retain items. The impact of dis/order is altered by consumers' comparison tendencies, waste aversion, and decision strategy (selection vs. rejection), which serve as theoretically and pragmatically relevant moderators. Though consumers' lay beliefs favor rejecting from order (i.e., choosing what to get rid of from tidy items), our findings point to the usefulness of selecting from disorder (i.e., choosing what to keep from messy items) as a downsizing strategy. Together, this research has implications for consumer downsizing activities, the burgeoning home organization and storage industries, as well as sustainability. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Sipilä J.; Alavi S.; Edinger-Schons L.M.; Dörfer S.; Schmitz C.	SAEDS_2021	Corporate social responsibility in luxury contexts: potential pitfalls and how to overcome them	Experiments	Yes	2021	Recent marketing research has identified mixed effects of luxury companies’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement on customer-level outcomes. To gain a better understanding of these effects, we develop a conceptual framework in which we propose that, unless carefully implemented, CSR engagement leads to lower financial performance, decreased customer loyalty, and elevated extrinsic CSR attributions for luxury companies. These effects are exacerbated if consumers actively deliberate on the company’s CSR efforts. However, luxury companies can mitigate these pitfalls and reap the potential rewards of CSR engagement by (1) engaging in company-internal, especially employee-focused CSR instead of company-external, philanthropic CSR or (2) framing their brands as sustainable instead of exclusive. We find consistent support for our theorizing in five empirical studies. The results contribute to existing knowledge on stakeholder reactions to luxury brands’ CSR and can help managers successfully navigate the implementation of CSR in luxury contexts. © 2020, The Author(s).

Sekhon T.S.; Armstrong Soule C.A.	SAS_2020	Conspicuous anticonsumption: When green demarketing brands restore symbolic benefits to anticonsumers	Experiments	Yes	2020	This article introduces the concept of conspicuous anticonsumption and provides evidence that it can be an effective means for green demarketing brands to encourage anticonsumption. Conspicuous anticonsumption refers to practices whereby brands provide visible signals imbued with meaning that consumers use to convey environmental motivations for consumption reduction activities. Two experiments suggest that without a signal, observers perceive anticonsumers to have lower socioeconomic status. However, when a visible signal communicates environmental motivations for anticonsumption actions, negative status inferences are mitigated and perceptions of the associated brand become more favorable. These visible signals confer status and restore the symbolic benefits that are often lost when consumption is forgone. Because symbolic benefits are powerful drivers of consumption choices, conspicuous anticonsumption can appeal to a broader base of moderate consumers. This practice has the potential to reduce negative environmental impact on a societal level as well as have positive outcomes for the brand. Counter to the prosocial perspective taken in most anticonsumption literature and activist thinking, This study highlights the importance of focusing on the personal symbolic benefits and costs of anticonsumption at the individual level. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SBM_2023	Achieving social and economic sustainability through innovations in transformative services: A case of healthcare organizations in an emerging market	Field Study	Yes	2023	Resource-poor organizations serve a significant portion of emerging markets’ healthcare industries. Such organizations engage in transformative services. However, given emerging markets’ ever-changing dynamics, it is unclear whether transformative services suffice for such organizations to move towards economic and social sustainability. We present two studies undertaken in the context of missionary hospitals in India. Study 1 identifies that hospitals rely on innovations in transformative services, driven by the co-creation of knowledge by various stakeholders, to remain socially and economically sustainable. Study 2 develops and tests hypotheses using data from 183 hospitals, showing that employee voice, community engagement, and diversity of organizational expertise increase innovation in transformative services at a decreasing rate, while resource munificence and commercialization emphasis moderate the antecedents’ effects. Post hoc analyses show that innovation in transformative services positively affect economic and social sustainability, and that awareness creating efforts moderate these relationships. More broadly, innovations in transformative services are critical for emerging markets’ resource-poor organizations’ economic and social sustainability. © 2023, Academy of Marketing Science.

SLE_2020	Cooperation with international NGOs and supplier assessment: Investigating the multiple mediating role of CSR activities in SMEs	Field Survey	Yes	2020	Nontraditional supply chain stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), may be able to affect the adoption of CSR practices in supply chains. However, little is known about how companies cooperate with international NGOs to handle supplier assessment. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling, we establish a parsimonious model that links cooperation with international NGOs to supplier assessment through three CSR dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Data collected from eight thousand SMEs in the transportation industry generally support the hypotheses. Moreover, our findings reveal that SMEs' size matters in the relationships between cooperation with international NGOs, CSR practices, and supplier assessment. Overall, this paper provides unique insights into the role that SME CSR activities play in the relationship between cooperation with international NGOs and supplier assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Salnikova E.; Strizhakova Y.; Coulter R.A.	SSC_2022	Engaging Consumers with Environmental Sustainability Initiatives: Consumer Global–Local Identity and Global Brand Messaging	Experiments	Yes	2022	Environmental sustainability is a common practice of global brands, with 90% of the top 100 Interbrand global brands making statements about environmental efforts on their websites. In this research, the authors explore how a consumer’s global–local identity can affect consumer engagement with a global brand’s environmental sustainability initiative. Specifically, they examine consumer engagement in response to environmental messaging based on regulatory focus, spatial construal, and temporal construal. They theorize and find, across six experimental studies, that consumers with a strong global identity are more engaged with environmental sustainability initiatives when messaging includes frames congruent with their global identity, specifically promotion frames coupled with distant spatial frames and with proximal temporal frames. For consumers with a local identity, these regulatory and construal messaging frames do not impact consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives. Consumer environmental mindset mediates the effect of global–local identity on consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives when such congruent frames are used, and consumer eagerness to act provides additional process explanation for the asymmetric spatial (distant) and temporal (proximal) construal effects. The findings have significant implications for the design of global brand and environmental policy messaging, particularly for consumers with a strong global identity. © American Marketing Association 2022.

SSDB_2022	Sweat it for sustainability: Impact of physical activity/exercise on sustainable consumption	Experiments	Yes	2022	What would make the “elusive” green consumer actually choose sustainable products? This research draws from “dopamine hypothesis of reward” to demonstrate that physical activity/exercise (regular and immediate) is a vital factor in determining consumers' sustainable behaviors. More specifically, it examines the role of physical activity/exercise on sustainable consumption behaviors as well as the role of emotional intelligence and sustainability claims. Five studies were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships. The findings from Study 1a and 1b establish direct causal link between physical activity/exercise and customers' sustainable consumption behaviors. Studies 2a and 2b show that emotional intelligence (trait-based and ability-based) may explain the effect of physical activity/exercise (regular and immediate) on sustainable consumption behaviors. Finally, the findings from Study 3 demonstrate that sustainability claims moderate the effect of emotional intelligence on sustainable consumption behaviors. These findings offer significant implications for retailers and marketers to use physical activity/exercise as a strategic intervention to positively influence consumers' evaluation and behaviors toward sustainable products. © 2022 The Authors.

Suher J.; Szocs C.; van Ittersum K.	SSI_2021	When imperfect is preferred: the differential effect of aesthetic imperfections on choice of processed and unprocessed foods	Experiments	Yes	2021	Some companies design processed foods to contain aesthetic imperfections such as non-uniformities in shape, color, or texture. Simultaneously, consumers annually discard millions of pounds of unprocessed, safe-to-eat fruits and vegetables owing to aesthetic imperfections. Why design processed foods with aesthetic imperfections when people discard unprocessed foods because of them? Seven studies, including a choice study at a grocery store and an incentive-compatible study, show that the effect of aesthetic imperfections on consumer preferences depends on whether foods are unprocessed or processed. While imperfections negatively influence preferences for unprocessed foods, they positively influence preferences for processed foods. We attribute this preference shift to consumers making opposing inferences about the human care involved in producing aesthetically imperfect processed and unprocessed foods. Building on research highlighting the positive effects of human presence in production, we thus show that perceived care drives food choice. We discuss implications for product design, retail promotion, and sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s).

Across four experimental studies, this research shows diametrically opposite “match-up” effects between advertising appeals and construal levels for luxury and sustainable brands. For a luxury brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a warmth (competence) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. In contrast, for a sustainable brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a competence (warmth) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. Further, these match-up effects are mediated by two distinct mechanisms: brand admiration (a high construal level) and processing fluency (a low construal level). Theoretical and managerial implications from these findings are discussed. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising.

Sun M.; Trudel R.	ST_2017	The effect of recycling versus trashing on consumption: Theory and experimental evidence	Experiments	Yes	2017	This article proposes a utilitarian model in which recycling could reduce consumers' negative emotions from wasting resources (i.e., taking more resources than what is being consumed) and increase consumers' positive emotions from disposing of consumed resources. The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy perspective, this research argues for a better understanding of consumers' disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of environmental policies and campaigns. © 2017, American Marketing Association.

Szocs C.; Williamson S.; Mills A.	SWM_2022	Contained: why it’s better to display some products without a package	Experimental	Yes	2022	Across varying marketplace contexts (e.g., grocery stores, restaurants, e-commerce) managers display products with and without packaging, seemingly arbitrarily. Does displaying a product packaged as opposed to unpackaged influence consumers’ product responses? Six controlled experiments and an Instagram study address this question. We focus primarily on food products but show our results extend to non-food products that are natural (i.e., originate from plants, animals, or humans). We propose that, in addition to its physical function, packaging acts as a symbolic barrier that separates the product from nature, decreasing perceived product naturalness and leading to less favorable product responses. Consistent with our theorizing, the negative effects of packaging attenuate when product information or retail signage highlights the product’s connection to nature and are contingent on the importance of product naturalness. Our findings have implications for strategic use of packaging in physical and digital merchandising and sustainability initiatives aimed at reducing packaging. © 2021, Academy of Marketing Science.

Trudel R.; Arg J.J.; Meng M.D.	TAM_2016	The recycled self: Consumers' disposal decisions of identity-linked products	Experiments	Yes	2016	It has been known for some time that consumers' identities influence purchasing decisions and people form strong identity connections, or "links," with products and brands. However, research has yet to determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at disposal in comparison to products that are not identity linked. Across seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer's identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further, the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by consumers' motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the self because it is viewed as an identity threat. In sum, consumers will be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product is linked to a consumer's identity. This occurs because placing an identitylinked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid. © The Author 2016.

Tezer A.; Bodur H.O.	TB_2021	The greenconsumption effect: How using green products improves consumption experience	Experiments	Yes	2021	In many situations, consumers use green products without a deliberate choice to use or purchase the product. This research explores how using a green product (e.g., a pair of headphones made from recycled materials) influences the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience (e.g., listening to music), even if consumers have not deliberately chosen or purchased the product. Five experiments in actual consumption settings revealed that using a green (vs. conventional) product enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience, referred to as the greenconsumption effect. Merely using a green product makes consumers perceive an increase in the extent to which they are valued as individuals by society, which leads to warm glow feelings, and consequently enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience. When consumers experience low social worth, the positive effect of using green products on the accompanying consumption experience is amplified. The greenconsumption effect disappears when the negative environmental impact of the green product attribute is low. From a managerial standpoint, the current research identifies instances where brands can benefit from going green and encourages marketers, especially service providers, to promote green products that are instrumental in consumption experiences. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

TBS_2015	Now that's a Bright Idea: The Influence of Consumer Elaboration and Distance Perceptions on Sustainable Choices	Experiments	Yes	2015	Integrating theory related to psychological distance and elaboration on potential outcomes, hypotheses are offered that predict that consumers' elaboration levels moderate the effect of temporal distance on choice of energy efficient products. In three experiments, the authors examine the influence of temporal and psychological distance and the moderating effect of a consumer's propensity to elaborate on potential outcomes (EPO) in retail choice-based situations. Results support these predictions with consumers lower in elaboration more likely to choose an energy efficient product when perceived distance is proximal versus distal, while the distance effect has less of an influence on consumers prone to higher elaboration. We test the effect of distance perceptions within a retail lab environment, as well as across ad and retail contexts. These results will help marketers better understand how to promote products in ad versus retail-based contexts and across different consumer groups. Findings offer implications for theory, retailers, product marketers, and NGO's interested in promoting energy efficient choices. © 2015 New York University.

Tarabashkina L.; Devine A.; Quester P.G.	TDQ_2020	Encouraging product reuse and upcycling via creativity priming, imagination and inspiration	Experiments	Yes	2022	Purpose: Consumers seldom consider end-use consumption (reuse or upcycling) when products reach the end of their lifecycle. This study shows that end-use consumption can be encouraged if individuals are primed to think creatively, engage in end-use ideation (imagine end-use) and become inspired by more original ideas. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies were carried out. Study 1 tested if creativity priming resulted in more effective end-use ideation (greater number of ideas and more original ideas) compared to environmental appeals and no intervention. Study 2 tested the effectiveness of creativity priming in a longitudinal setting. Study 3 demonstrated how creativity priming and end-use ideation could be practically executed using product packaging. Findings: Creativity priming represents an effective intervention to stimulate end-use consumption with particularly positive results amongst less creative consumers. However, it was not the number of generated ideas, but their originality during end-use ideation that triggered inspiration. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates which interventions are more effective in changing consumer behaviour in favour of more sustainable practices. Practical implications: Increasing environmental degradation requires consumers to change their behaviour by re-consuming products. This study shows that consumers can adopt end-use if they are primed to think creatively, imagine end-use consumption and generate more original ideas. Originality/value: Creative thinking has been leveraged at product development stages, but not at the end of products’ lifecycle. This study integrated creativity priming, consumer imagination and inspiration theories to explain the underlying mechanism behind end-use consumption to scale up its adoption by consumers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Tang Y.; Felix R.; Hinsch C.	TFH_2024	Ritual and environmental ineffectiveness: How psychological ownership of community drives environmental behavior	Experiments	Yes	2024	Psychological ownership has been linked to various environmental behaviors, but extant research has typically examined a specific environmental element (i.e., a lake or national park) instead of abstract entities as the target of this ownership. The current research investigates how psychological ownership of an abstract entity, namely one's community, impacts environmental attitudes and behaviors. Intrigued by previous research showing that consumer concern for the environment does not necessarily translate into pro-environmental action, we examine the connection between psychological ownership, environmental concern, and environmental behaviors. We propose and find that the perception of environmental ineffectiveness moderates how these variables relate to one another. Counterintuitively, higher levels of perceived environmental ineffectiveness (rather than effectiveness) strengthen the relationships between these variables. We draw on the theory of ritualistic behaviors to explain this phenomenon. Results from three studies using diverse respondents and data gathering approaches reveal a consistent pattern of relationships. Our research makes several important contributions. First, it identifies a quasi-endowment effect that extends from psychological ownership of community to environmental concern, which subsequently results in the protection of the environment through engagement in environmental behaviors. Second, this research extends the burgeoning psychological literature on rituals to the domain of environmental behaviors. Finally, using the conceptualization of environmental behavior as a ritual, this is the first study to illustrate how perceived consumer ineffectiveness moderates the effect of psychological ownership on environmental behaviors through environmental concern. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Thøgersen J.; Haugaard P.; Olesen A.	THO_2010	Consumer responses to ecolabels	Field Survey	Yes	2010	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a framework for understanding consumer responses to ecolabelling. Design/methodology/approach: From a consumer perspective, ecolabels are tools for supporting decision making with regard to environmentally significant products. The paper proposes an adoption of innovation framework for understanding consumer responses. The framework is applied in a mall-intercept survey of the early adoption of a new ecolabel, the MSC label for sustainable fishery, in Denmark. Findings: Early adopters of a new ecolabel mostly employ a high effort adoption process. Starting the adoption process depends on both motivation (intention to buy sustainable fish products) and ability (issue-relevant knowledge). Whether and how quickly the consumer completes the adoption depends on his or her motivation, past experience with using ecolabels, and trust in the endorsing organisation. Research limitations/implications: Environmental and product-related factors did not differ between respondents. Hence, a complete account of the importance of these factors for the adoption and (especially) diffusion of the label is not provided. Practical implications: Consumers scoring highly on both issue-relevant knowledge and motivation are the most likely innovators and early adopters. Their high level of expertise means that they do not need a lot of explanation for understanding the label and its self-relevance and their strong motivation means that they will search for more if they need it (and if it is not too difficult to get). Originality/value: The paper makes both a conceptual and an empirical contribution, which are of value both to practitioners (ecolabel promoters and users) and to research on ecolabel effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Tanner C.; Kast S.W.	TK_2003	Promoting Sustainable Consumption: Determinants of Green Purchases by Swiss Consumers	Survey	Yes	2003	Given that overconsumption in industrial countries is a main cause of environmental degradation, a shift toward more sustainable consumption patterns is required. This study attempts to uncover personal and contextual barriers to consumers' purchases of green food and to strengthen knowledge about fostering green purchases. Survey data are used to examine the influence of distinct categories of personal factors (such as attitudes, personal norms, perceived behavior barriers, knowledge) and contextual factors (such as socioeconomic characteristics, living conditions, and store characteristics) on green purchases of Swiss consumers. Results from regression analysis suggest that green food purchases are facilitated by positive attitudes of consumers toward (a) environmental protection, (b) fair trade, (c) local products, and (d) availability of action-related knowledge. In turn, green behavior is negatively associated with (e) perceived time barriers and (f) frequency of shopping in supermarkets. Surprisingly, green purchases are not significantly related to moral thinking, monetary barriers, or the socioeconomic characteristics of the consumers. Implications for policy makers and for companies and marketers engaged in the promotion and commercialization of green products are discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Techawachirakul M.; Pathak A.; Motoki K.; Calvert G.A.	TPMC_2023	Negative halo effects of sustainable packaging	Experiments	Yes	2023	More firms are adopting “green packaging” due to regulatory and environmental concerns. The alcoholic beverage industry has recently joined the lobby and major producers have introduced creative paper bottles for their alcoholic drinks. Previous research on sustainable labeling (e.g., eco-friendly labels) has shown the positive halo effect where sustainable labeling induces positive evaluations. In contrast, our research aims to reveal the negative halo effects of sustainable packaging in the case of paper-bottled alcoholic beverages. Across three studies, we explore consumers' perceptions toward alcoholic drinks packed in innovative paper bottles. Studies 1–2 demonstrate that consumers hold inferior expectations (i.e., sensory attributes, price, and purchase likelihood) toward alcoholic beverages packed in paper bottles. Study 3 demonstrates that the enforced messaging and attractive packaging can mitigate the negative halo effect for self-consumption and gifting. These findings contribute to the literature on sustainable packaging, especially in the novel space of paper-bottled alcoholic drinks. © 2023 The Authors.

Tari A.; Trudel R.	TT_2024	Affording Disposal Control: The Effect of Circular Take-Back Programs on Psychological Ownership and Valuation	Experiments	Yes	2024	A circular economy is a “closed-loop” system designed so that products flow back into the production cycle after use. With many companies implementing take-back programs as part of their sustainability strategy, a fundamental shift in consumption has occurred, with consumers considering disposal during and even before purchase decision making. Eight experiments reveal that consumers indicate a greater willingness to pay for circular program products. An increase in psychological ownership underlies the difference in product valuation. Specifically, the additional disposal control uniquely afforded by circular products increases the capacity of circular take-back program products to evoke psychological ownership. The process explanation is directly tested through mediation. Experimentally manipulating antecedents of psychological ownership (i.e., disposal control and psychological ownership) provides further support for the conceptual framework. © American Marketing Association 2023.

Urien B.; Kilbourne W.	UK_2011	Generativity and self-enhancement values in eco-friendly behavioral intentions and environmentally responsible consumption behavior	Survey	Yes	2011	During the past 35 years, academic researchers have been examining the relationship between environmentally responsible consumption behavior and numerous antecedent variables. Because sustainability requires a long-term perspective, the study included generativity, a construct developed by Erikson (1950) and self-enhancement values (Schwartz, 1994) as antecedent variables for environmentally responsible consumption behavior. Generativity refers to individuals' beliefs that their current behavior has consequences that extend into future generations, while self-enhancement refers to values relating to power, wealth, and influence. These variables are related in that generativity requires consideration of others while self-enhancement generally refers to considering only one's self. This suggests that individuals high on generativity ought to be more aware of and concerned about the environment and should modify their behavior accordingly, and those who are high on self-enhancement should be less concerned or willing to change behavior. The results of the study, including French and American respondents, indicate that individuals who score high on generativity are more likely to have eco-friendly intentions and more environmentally responsible consumption behaviors, but generativity interacts with self-enhancement, resulting in an interpretation that is different from that typically found in environmentally related studies. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

de Visser-Amundson A.; Peloza J.; Kleijnen M.	VAPK_2021	How Association with Physical Waste Attenuates Consumer Preferences for Rescue-Based Food	Experiments	Yes	2021	In an effort to combat food waste, many firms have introduced rescue-based foods (RBFs), which are made from ingredients that are safe to eat but would otherwise be wasted, often due to aesthetic issues or oversupply. Although the benefits of RBF are varied, some firms adopt strategies that highlight RBF’s waste-reduction benefits, such as reduced landfill use or lower environmental impact. This research posits that when firms adopt strategies that highlight associations between physical waste and RBF, those associations can generate negative mental imagery, which can trigger disgust and mitigate positive consumer attitudes toward RBF. When such associations are not present, demand is consistent with demand for conventional foods. The authors find support for the role of mental imagery in this demand mitigation process, with some promotional appeals stimulating thoughts of physical waste. Counterintuitively, this research reveals that when marketers adopt the common practice of using environmental benefit appeals that can trigger physical waste associations, such as the color green, consumer demand for RBF diminishes. Conversely, focusing on the societal benefits or limiting the number of cues available to create physical waste associations generates consumer demand for these foods on a level equivalent to that of conventional food. © American Marketing Association 2021.

Vesal M.; Siahtiri V.; O'Cass A.	VSO_2021	Strengthening B2B brands by signalling environmental sustainability and managing customer relationships	Field Survey	Yes	2021	Resource depletion and environmental pollution concerns are forcing manufacturers to pay greater attention to environmental sustainability. This is especially so for business-to-business (B2B) manufacturing firms who intensively use natural resources in their operations and are blamed for observable impacts on the environment. Despite investments in environmental sustainability practices by B2B manufacturers, studies provide little explanation about the extent B2B manufacturers obtain a positive brand image and superior market performance through environmental sustainability. Furthermore, research has not identified organisational practices that strengthen the path from environmental sustainability to market performance. Drawing on signalling theory, the customer relationship management (CRM) literature, attitude theory, and data collected from B2B manufacturers and their customers, we show that environmental sustainability practices provide positive benefits to B2B manufacturers' brand image, which, in turn, impacts market performance. Further, effective CRM and working with business customers with positive environmental attitudes are essential boundary conditions that strengthen the path from environmental sustainability practices to market performance. © 2020	Industrial Marketing Management	10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.02.024	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081027906&doi=10.1016%2fj.indmarman.2020.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=5b24da235e9cf19259be832939ee82e3
Wood S.	W_2012	Prone to progress: Using personality to identify supporters of innovative social entrepreneurship	Experimental	Yes	2012	One of the main challenges in social entrepreneurship is capturing stakeholder support-from consumers, to legislators, to volunteers, to many others. Identifying likely supporters is the first step to sustainable success, but a difficult one. This research examines whether personality influences a person's tendency to support innovative social entrepreneurial (SE) ventures. Here, the possible influence of the "Big Five" personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism [OCEAN]) is examined; however, in line with prior research, attention is focused on both openness (an OCEAN trait) and empathy (a non-OCEAN trait). Two types of SE ventures are considered: social innovations and technological innovations. Data from a survey evaluating six SE ventures (three social and three technological) reveal that participants' personality influences support; however, observed influence differs by type of venture-openness underlies support of technological innovations, and empathy underlies support of social innovations. Further process analysis demonstrates that this influence is not direct but rather is mediated by people's perceptions of how much change the venture will make. These results offer social entrepreneurs insights into who might be prone to support SE ventures and, more important, why. © 2012, American Marketing Association.

WDGB_2024	Measuring latent individual difference variables with a conjoint design and structural equation modeling	Experiments	Yes	2024	Researchers often measure consumers’ responsiveness to a certain attribute (e.g., how much consumers value sustainability in products or low prices). Traditionally, this has been done by using multi-item self-report scales. We propose the use of a rating-based conjoint design analyzed with structural equation modeling as an alternative. To illustrate the approach, we apply it to the measurement of eco-utility. In doing so, we evaluate three likely advantages of the conjoint-based approach relative to traditional self-reports: (a) reduced bias due to Acquiescence Response Style, (b) reduced bias due to socially desirable responding, and (c) enhanced ability to control for the effects of product attributes that may be confounded with the focal attribute (e.g., price may be confounded with sustainability). Our results provide preliminary support for each of the proposed advantages. We conclude with implications for measurement and discuss how the current approach offers new ideas on how to measure latent variables. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

WHG_2018	Temporal myopia in sustainable behavior under uncertainty	Experiments	Yes	2018	Consumers in today's world are confronted with the alarming consequences of unsustainable behavior such as pollution and resource degradation. In addition, they are facing increases in uncertainty due to external events such as economic crises and terror attacks. These two problems are central to consumers’ lives, occur on a global scale, and have significant impact on the world's political, economic, environmental, and social landscapes. Contributing to research on persuasion and pro-social behavior, we show in four studies, conducted online, in the lab, and in the field, that these two problems are interconnected. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that uncertainty leads to lower levels of sustainable behavior in comparison to certainty. Study 2 reveals in addition that this is due to the display of higher levels of temporal discounting under uncertainty (i.e., adopting a more immediate orientation). Finally, Studies 3 and 4 show that emphasizing the immediate benefits of sustainability during uncertainty reverses the negative effect and leads consumers to act more sustainably. Overall, these findings provide valuable implications for policy makers and responsible marketers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When and why cuteness appeals influence prosocial and sustainable behavior	Experiments	Yes	2017	Policy makers and social agencies need novel insights to manage the major global challenge of encouraging prosocial and sustainable behaviors. This research identifies a positive aesthetic cue, "Kindchenschema cuteness," that can reliably induce some people-specifically, those who exhibit high approach motivational orientation (per the behavioral approach system [BAS]; Carver and White 1994)- to engage in prosocial and conservation behaviors. Studies 1 and 2 show that consumers high (vs. low) in BAS (measured) react more favorably to conservation appeals featuring cuteness, an effect mediated by experienced feelings of tenderness. Study 3 replicates the effect usinga prime of approach motivation (BAS) to assess donation intentions. Study 4, a large-scale field experiment conducted over eight weeks at multiple locations, shows that people recycle more at bins featuring cute visuals with active (high-BAS) messages compared with bins featuring cute visuals with passive (low-BAS) messages.

Winterich K.P.; Nenkov G.Y.; Gonzales G.E.	WNG_2019	Knowing What It Makes: How Product Transformation Salience Increases Recycling	Experiments	Yes	2019	Recycling campaigns abound, but do consumers think about what becomes of those recyclables? This research proposes that product transformation salience (thinking about recyclables turning into new products) increases recycling. The authors theorize that consumers are inspired by the transformation of recyclables into new products and that this inspiration motivates them to recycle. The authors demonstrate the effect of product transformation messages on recycling behavior using a recycling campaign (Study 1) and advertisements for products made from recycled plastic (Study 2). Study 3 demonstrates the mediating role of inspiration. Then, three field studies provide robust support for the transformation salience effect through click-through rates for recycling advertisements (Study 4), recycling rates during pre–football game tailgating (Study 5), and a reduction in the amount of recyclable materials incorrectly placed in the landfill bin by students in a university residence hall (Study 6). The authors discuss implications for the design of recycling campaigns and positioning of recycled products in the marketplace as well as theoretical contributions regarding the roles of transformation salience and inspiration in encouraging recycling and other sustainable behaviors. © American Marketing Association 2019.

White K.; Simpson B.; Argo J.J.	WSA_2014	The motivating role of dissociative out-groups in encouraging positive consumer behaviors	Experiments	Yes	2014	Previous research has found that people tend to avoid products or behaviors that are linked to dissociative reference groups. The present research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer)s group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not. They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together, the results highlight conditions under which communicating information about the behaviors of dissociative out-groups can be used to spur consumers to engage in positive actions. © 2014, American Marketing Association.

Wilken R.; Schmitt J.; Dost F.; Bürgin D.	WSDB_2024	Does the presentation of true costs at the point of purchase nudge consumers toward sustainable product options?	Experiments	Yes	2024	Do true cost campaigns (TCCs)—which display prices at the point of purchase that include social and environmental negative externalities—nudge consumers toward more expensive sustainable products? From a theoretical point of view, the answer is promising: Communicating true costs means introducing external reference prices that provide a benchmark for consumers to assess price acceptability. Showing true costs triggers a general reference to the price of sustainability, and the higher price of sustainable products becomes at least partially explained by their lower “hidden costs” (i.e., costs to compensate for all environmental and social impacts). In two empirical studies, we demonstrate that for TCCs to be effective, the hidden costs for the sustainable products must be lower than those for the conventional alternatives. Interestingly, under this condition, TCCs have an effect in markets characterized by a larger (study 1) and a smaller (study 2) green gap. In both studies, we find that increased perceived price fairness explains the effect of TCCs, as measured by the relative preference for the sustainable compared to the conventional product. In addition, we see that the price difference between the two products plays a significant role in forming this preference judgment, independent of other factors included in the model and especially independent of TCC. © 2023, The Author(s).

Consider production waste in garment manufacturing -which has been criticized for wasteful use of natural resources (e.g., using excessive water and fabric) and wasteful disposal of resource residuals (e.g., discarding excessive wastewater and fabric scraps). The present research examines consumer reactions to production waste and its mitigation as a function of whether it is characterized in terms of resource use versus disposal. A series of seven studies (including field and secondary data) finds that (i) consumers are less sensitive to wasteful resource use than disposal due to lower perceptions of environmental harm; (ii) likewise, consumers are less sensitive to waste mitigation targeting resource use than disposal due to lower perceptions of environmental benefit; and (iii) these waste reaction differences are attenuated when resource scarcity or long-term orientation is heightened (which increases consumer sensitivity to resource use). Together, this research sheds light on how, why, and when consumers are averse to production waste, while providing guidance regarding interventions focused on fighting production waste and promoting sustainability.  © The Author(s) 2023.

Xu L.; Zhao S.; Cotte J.; Cui N.	XZCC_2023	Cyclical Time Is Greener: The Impact of Temporal Perspective on Pro-Environmental Behavior	Experiments	Yes	2023	The natural environment is deteriorating. However, humans have not slowed down their pace of resource depletion and environmental destruction. This research takes a particular path to understanding environmental consumption- through a focus on temporal perspective. Evidence from six studies demonstrates the positive effect of a cyclical temporal perspective, versus a linear temporal perspective, on consumers' pro-environmental behavior. The research shows that individuals with a cyclical perspective are more likely to include the environment in the self, which leads to higher pro-environmental behavioral intentions and more pro-environmental behavior. This temporal perspective effect is attenuated for consumers already high on green values. The authors also examine a marketercontrolled moderator and show that consumers are more likely to purchase a pro-environmental product when they see a temporal-perspective-congruent promotional appeal. The research contributes to both the time perception and the environmental consumption literature and offers several practical implications for organizations to promote sustainable consumer behavior.  © The Author(s) 2023.

Yan L.; Keh H.T.; Chen J.	YKC_2021	Assimilating and Differentiating: The Curvilinear Effect of Social Class on Green Consumption	Survey	Yes	2021	Building on optimal distinctiveness theory, this research examines the effects of social class on green consumption. Across six studies, we find a curvilinear effect of social class on green consumption, with the middle class having greater propensity for green consumption compared to the lower and upper classes. This effect can be explained by tension between need for assimilation (NFA) and need for differentiation (NFD) that varies among the three social classes in establishing their optimally distinctive identities. The lower class has a dominant NFA, the upper class has a dominant NFD, and the middle class has dual motivation for assimilation and differentiation. Concomitantly, green consumption has the dual function of assimilation and differentiation. The middle class perceives green consumption as simultaneously assimilating and differentiating, which satisfies their dual motivation and enhances their propensity for green consumption. By contrast, the lower class perceives the differentiation function of green consumption as contradicting their dominant NFA, and the upper class perceives the assimilation function as contradicting their dominant NFD, which lower both their propensities for green consumption. Furthermore, these effects are moderated by consumers' power distance belief. These novel findings have significant theoretical and practical implications on building a more sustainable society. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Yan L.; Keh H.T.; Murray K.B.	YKM_2024	Feeling the values: How pride and awe differentially enhance consumers’ sustainable behavioral intentions	Experiments	Yes	2024	Building on prior work examining discrete emotions and consumer behavior, the present research proposes that consumers are more likely to engage in the target sustainable behavior when marketers use an emotional appeal that matches the brand’s expressed values or one that is congruent with consumers’ value priority. In particular, we focus on two contrasting positive emotions—pride and awe. We show that the effectiveness of pride and awe appeals depends on the corresponding human values. Specifically, pride increases sustainable behavior and intentions when the self-enhancement value is prioritized; and awe increases sustainable behavior and intentions when the self-transcendence value is prioritized. Importantly, this interaction can be explained by enhanced self-efficacy. We demonstrate these effects across six studies, including a field study. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of sustainable consumption, reconcile prior research, and provide practical guidance for marketers and policy-makers. © 2023, The Author(s).

Yan L.; Murray K.B.	YM_2023	The motivational dynamics of arousal and values in promoting sustainable behavior: A cognitive energetics perspective	Experiments	Yes	2023	This research applies Cognitive Energetics Theory (CET) to explain when and why consumers engage in sustainable behavior. Across six studies, we find a positive interaction effect of arousal and openness-to-change on sustainable behaviors. In particular, openness-to-change (vs conservation) increases the likelihood of engaging in effortful sustainable behaviors in a high-arousal state rather than in a low-arousal state. Interestingly, our results reveal that this interactive effect is explained by the tendency of consumers to believe that the target sustainable behavior requires less effort, when they are in a high-arousal state and endorsing openness-to-change. Moreover, perceived effort is positively related to sustainable behavior for experienced consumers but negatively related to the behavior for less experienced consumers. In addition, the effect of value and arousal on perceived effort is stronger among less experienced consumers but attenuated among more experienced consumers. Thus, arousal can serve as a catalyst to enhance value-consistent sustainable behaviors and help the less experienced consumers form habits. These findings contribute to CET by highlighting the important roles that values and arousal play in the motivational forces that drive and restrain sustainable behaviors. The results improve our understanding of how to motivate value-consistent sustainable behaviors, with implications for both marketers and policy-makers. © 2022 The Authors	International Journal of Research in Marketing	10.1016/j.ijresmar.2022.12.004	No	Sustainab*	https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146270470&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijresmar.2022.12.004&partnerID=40&md5=a1f479f60683c8dacffb16a0e06dfe29
Yu X.; Tao Y.; Wang D.; Yang M.M.	YTWY_2022	Disengaging pro-environmental values in B2B green buying decisions: Evidence from a conjoint experiment	Field Survey	Yes	2022	Although the seriousness of environmental issues has prompted calls for more green concerns in B2B buying, research has not given the area the attention it deserves. Building on social cognitive theory, we examine the role of pro-environmental values in B2B green buying decisions, and the moderation effects of purchasing experience and environmental hostility. We test our theoretical model by using hierarchical linear modeling with data from a conjoint experiment consisting of 816 purchase assessments nested in 102 B2B purchasing managers. Our results indicate that B2B purchasing managers disengage their pro-environmental values in B2B green buying decisions when they have little purchasing experience and perceive the business environment as highly hostile. This study offers important managerial implications for B2B purchasing managers and business owners/entrepreneurs that pursue sustainable development of their organizations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Zhang J.; Sheng S.; Xu X.	ZSX_2023	How perceived life control shapes sustainable consumption: The role of outcome efficacy	Survey	Yes	2023	Sustainable consumption helps solve today's critical environmental problems, but such behavior tends to be altruistic, mainly benefiting the environment and other people. Thus, understanding precursors that drive a consumer to engage in sustainable consumption is important for scholars and green product marketers. This study examines how perceived life control—a factor not directly related to environmental decisions—influences sustainable purchase. Data from two waves of the World Value Survey indicate that perceived life control is positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes (which is a precondition for sustainable purchases). Five subsequent studies consistently show that perceived life control increases purchase intention for green products, and this happens because consumers with greater life control believe their purchases will be more effective in solving environmental problems (i.e., outcome efficacy). We further reveal that framing the benefits of a green product as temporally present (vs. future) attenuates the observed effect. These findings suggest that the practice of sustainable consumption may be explained by perceived life control in individuals and provide insights for environmental communication regarding the alignment between sustainable product appeals and individual differences. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Zhang L.; Wu J.; Chen H.; Nguyen B.	ZWCN_2020	Does one bad apple ruin a firm’s green brand image? Examining frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors	Experiments	Yes	2020	Purpose: Drawing on the branded service encounters perspective, the purpose of this study is to investigate how frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors affect customers’ brand evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: The research conducted two experiments. The first experiment explored the effect of frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors on customers’ brand evaluations via corporate hypocrisy. The second experiment explored the moderation effect of employees’ prototypicality and the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) among customers. Findings: Experiment 1 indicates that for firms with a green brand image, frontline employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors result in customers’ perception that the firm is hypocritical, thus reducing their brand evaluations. Experiment 2 shows that employee prototypicality and CSR importance to the customer enhance the negative impact of frontline employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors on customers’ brand evaluations through customers’ perception of corporate hypocrisy. Research limitations/implications: This study is one of the first efforts to explore how frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors affect customers’ responses. It helps understand the impact of frontline employees’ counter-productive sustainable behaviors on customers’ brand perception, as well as the relationship between CSR and employees. Practical implications: This study suggests that firms’ green brand image does not always lead to positive customer response. When frontline employees’ behaviors are inconsistent with firms’ green brand image, it can trigger customers’ perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and thus influence their brand evaluations. Therefore, firms should train frontline service employees to make their behaviors align with the firms’ green brand image. Originality/value: This study is one of the first efforts to explore how frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors affect customers’ responses. It helps understand the impact of frontline employees’ counter-productive sustainable behaviors on customers’ brand perception, as well as the relationship between CSR and employee. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

Zhang M.; Zeng W.; Tse Y.K.; Wang Y.; Smart P.	ZZTWS_2021	Examining the antecedents and consequences of green product innovation	Field Survey	Yes	2021	As an important part of social innovation, green product innovation (GPI) is widely regarded as a beneficial strategy for firms to achieve sustainable success. While the way to effectively leverage GPI has not been fully invested. To address this lack, this study examines the antecedent role of inter-organizational control mechanism by investigating the nature of the interplay between formal control and social control in relation to green supply chain collaboration. In addition, we probe the impact of GPI on firm triple bottom line due to the inconsistent results in existing literature. Based on a sample of 239 senior managers and directors in the Chinese manufacturing industry, we test the hypotheses through moderated structural equations modelling. The results show that formal control and social control should be applied as complements in promoting GPI, while only working on Moreover, enhance the awareness and adoption of GPI stimulates better environmental performance and social performance as a result. The relationship between GPI and financial performance is mediated by both environmental and social performance. Our findings will help B2B participants understand the GPI and potential sustainable, social and economic outcomes, and support them formulate more effective control mechanism strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
