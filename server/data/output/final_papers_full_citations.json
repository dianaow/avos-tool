    "Year": "2023",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Because steadily growing consumption is not beneficial for nature and climate and is not the same as increasing well-being, an anti-consumerism movement has formed worldwide. The renouncement of dispensable consumption will, however, only establish itself as a significant lifestyle if consumers do not perceive reduced consumption as a personal sacrifice. Since prior research has not yielded a consistent understanding of the relationship between anti-consumption and personal well-being, this paper aims to examine three factors about which theory implies that they may moderate this relationship: decision-control empowerment, market-control empowerment and the value of materialism. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on data from a large-scale, representative online survey (N = 1,398). Structural equation modelling with latent interaction effects is used to test how three moderators (decision-control empowerment, market-control empowerment and materialism) affect the relationship amongst four types of anti-consumption (e.g. voluntary simplicity) and three different well-being states (e.g. subjective well-being). Findings: While both dimensions of empowerment almost always directly promote consumer well-being, significant moderation effects are present in only a few but meaningful cases. Although the materialism value tends to reduce consumers’ well-being, it improves the well-being effect of two anti-consumption styles. Research limitations/implications: Using only one sample from a wealthy country is a limitation of the study. Researchers should replicate the findings in different nations and cultures. Practical implications: Consumer affairs practitioners and commercial marketing for sustainably produced, high-quality and long-lasting goods can benefit greatly from these findings. Social implications: This paper shows that sustainable marketing campaigns can more easily motivate consumers to voluntarily reduce their consumption for the benefit of society and the environment if a high level of market-control empowerment can be communicated to them. Originality/value: This study provides differentiated new insights into the roles of consumer empowerment, i.e. both decision-control empowerment and market-control empowerment, and the value of materialism to frame specific relationships between different anti-consumption types and various well-being states. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Source title": "Marketing Letters",
    "Abstract": "In recent years, increasing attention is evident with regard to the depletion of natural resources, the development of \"green\" products and services and the sustainability practices of organisations. Building on Regulatory Focus theory (Higgins, Organ Behav Hum Decis Processes 69(2):117-132, 1997), we examine the difference between a promotion focus for marketing products and services (which emphasises attainment, achievement and advancement) and a prevention focus (which emphasises protection, security and responsibility). The results of three empirical studies show that (1) perceived sustainability practices of a company activate a prevention focus in consumers, (2) consumers make prevention-focused inferences about the products of a sustainable company, and (3) sustainable products are perceived to be better positioned if they are marketed with prevention-framed (vs. promotion-framed) appeals. This suggests that companies with sustainability-oriented practices and product offerings will be more effective if they use prevention-focused appeals in their marketing efforts. Implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Source title": "International Marketing Review",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to investigate an under-researched area, an international marketing perspective, based on international dynamic capability, environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance in gamification and non-gamification-based organizational culture (OC). This paper deepens the understanding of gamification-based and non-gamification-based OC influence on innovation capability and environmental and organizational marketing performance through the theory of organizational creativity and the theory of administrative behavior (AB). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data from firms that abide by the ISO 14091 certifications to ensure the proper quality standards. Primary data from 384 firms are used to test the hypotheses. The results would help firms invest in technological solutions by practicing creativity over time. Additionally, the study helps explore how AB is critical in steering technological creativity for making firms climate-conscious. Findings: The study's findings identified that OC has a positive influence on technological innovation capabilities and environmental innovation capabilities. Technological innovation capabilities have a beneficial impact on environmental sustainability. Environmental sustainability appears to have a substantial correlation with technological innovation skills. Environmental innovation capabilities positively impact environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance. A moderating effect of gamification on the international dynamic capabilities within a relationship between organizational culture and environmental innovation capabilities exists. Originality/value: The investigation is confined to understanding how gamification-based and non-gamification-based organizational marketing culture affects innovation capability, environmental sustainability and organizational performance through the lens of theory of organizational creativity and theory of AB. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "As a result of the dramatic increase in global population, food waste, and unsustainable practices, the United Nations urges the promotion of edible insects as an alternative food source. However, edible insects are perceived as an unappealing, disgusting food source despite the nutritional and sustainable advantages, especially among Westerners. Therefore, research is needed to bridge the gap between the call for examining alternative food sources and the marketing initiatives to improve purchasing behavior. This research draws upon information processing and risk perception theories to investigate reducing consumers' negative perceptions toward edible insect food products. The first study examines the effect of image and description in a retail setting while the second study examines a restaurant setting. Results find that in retail settings image was the most significant in reducing perceptions of risk while in the restaurant setting menu description was most important. In addition, vague descriptions were more preferable to explicit descriptions in minimizing risk and increasing purchase intention. Finally, the research provides meaningful implications for the marketers who endeavor to promote alternative food products as well as any products that involve negative and unfamiliar perceptions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Source title": "Journal of Consumer Research",
    "Abstract": "Why are men less likely than women to embrace environmentally friendly products and behaviors? Whereas prior research attributes this gender gap in sustainable consumption to personality differences between the sexes, we propose that it may also partially stem from a prevalent association between green behavior and femininity, and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are more feminine. Building on prior findings that men tend to be more concerned than women with gender-identity maintenance, we argue that this green-feminine stereotype may motivate men to avoid green behaviors in order to preserve a macho image. A series of seven studies provides evidence that the concepts of greenness and femininity are cognitively linked and shows that, accordingly, consumers who engage in green behaviors are stereotyped by others as more feminine and even perceive themselves as more feminine. Further, men's willingness to engage in green behaviors can be influenced by threatening or affirming their masculinity, as well as by using masculine rather than conventional green branding. Together, these findings bridge literatures on identity and environmental sustainability and introduce the notion that due to the green-feminine stereotype, gender identity maintenance can influence men's likelihood of adopting green behaviors. © 2016.

    "Year": "2021",
    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "Journal of Consumer Psychology",
    "Abstract": "Prior research has suggested that consumers believe that products made using sustainable, environmentally friendly technologies are likely to underperform those made using traditional methods. We question the robustness of this assumption and identify scenarios in which sustainability is likely to have the opposite effect, strengthening rather than weakening consumers' product performance beliefs. Specifically, we argue that sustainability is likely to produce a halo effect able to attenuate and even override the negative impact of compensatory inferences underlying consumers' belief that sustainability comes at the expense of performance. We propose that this halo effect stems from consumers' view of the company as a moral agent engaged in a prosocial behavior. In this context, we identify two factors that are likely to influence the strength of the halo effect: the degree to which consumers view the company as a moral agent whose actions aim to benefit society and the degree to which moral concerns are prominent in consumers' minds. Following this line of reasoning, we identify two ways in which managers can increase the perceived performance of sustainable products: by associating sustainable benefits with the company rather than with its products and by emphasizing the societal benefits of sustainability. We test these predictions in a series of four empirical studies that show convergent evidence for our theorizing. Our findings have important public policy implications, documenting actionable strategies that managers can use to mitigate the potential negative impact of sustainability and strengthen the perceived performance of sustainable products. © 2020 Society for Consumer Psychology",

    "Abstract": "Prior research has suggested that consumers believe sustainable products tend to underperform compared with those made using traditional methods, a phenomenon referred to as the “sustainability liability.” Despite early conceptual justification and evidence supporting this argument, recent research has not attempted to validate this effect and assess its practical relevance. By employing a variety of scenarios adapted from prior studies, the authors quantify the magnitude of the sustainability-liability effect and show that it is relatively small and unlikely to be meaningful. This research also estimates the boundary conditions to identify scenarios in which a significant sustainability-liability effect might occur. Using archival data, the authors demonstrate that the association between sustainability and inferior product performance has decreased over time, explaining the discrepancy between their findings and prior research. These findings have important public policy implications, providing decision makers with empirical evidence that designing and promoting eco-friendly products can benefit society without detracting from the perceived performance of the company's offerings. © American Marketing Association 2024.",

    "Abstract": "Triple bottom line (TBL) is a concept of business which highlights that firms should not measure their business success based only on their financial performance, but they should also measure their social and environmental impacts. In other words, the concept of triple bottom line also includes people, planet, and profit. Also, dynamic capabilities help a firm to address rapid environmental changes, and studies have shown that they can improve a firm's sustainability performance. Other studies have shown that TBL initiatives can also improve a firm's sustainability performance. But no studies have investigated how dynamic abilities as well as TBL initiatives could simultaneously impact sustainability performance of B2B firms in the post COVID-19 period. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the implications of dynamic capabilities on TBL performance after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially from the B2B marketing perspective. Drawing on dynamic capability view (DCV), TBL theory and the extant literature, a conceptual research model was developed which was subsequently validated with the PLS-SEM technique using 377 responses from different manufacturing and service-oriented firms. This is the first study to extensively analyze the combined impacts of these two dimensions on firms' sustainability performance, and thus it has enriched the literature related to DCV, TBL, and sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

This article examines the effects of mass media in the context of the U.S. hybrid vehicle market. Drawing on monthly sales data, the authors provide evidence that the general coverage of climate change or global warming by major media outlets exerts an overall positive impact on the sales of hybrid vehicles. This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase. They provide implications for theory and practice and call for future research that examines the causal impact of media in general on consumer decisions, especially in domains that are crucial for the society. © American Marketing Association 2019.",

    "Abstract": "Minimalism, which encourages people to live with fewer possessions, is an emerging theme in marketing communication that often appeals to the sustainable ideal of reducing consumption and waste (e.g., Patagonia's “Buy less” campaign). However, consumers' responses to this marketing approach remain under-researched. We investigate whether consumers' responses to minimalist appeals depend on their socioeconomic status. We find that consumers with lower socioeconomic status report less favorable evaluations of brands that adopt minimalist appeals, because these consumers tend to prefer quantity over quality in daily consumption—a preference that is incongruent with minimalism. This effect is moderated by the considerations of product-usage frequency: even consumers with low socioeconomic status can become more favorable toward minimalist brands if the benefit of minimalism, namely the increased usage of each product, is salient. © 2023 The Authors.

    "Source title": "Journal of Public Policy and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "In an effort to make urban transportation more sustainable, policy makers and social marketers have turned increased attention to bicycling. The authors apply behavioral reasoning theory to investigate consumers' mental processing of bicycle commuting to better understand why such an active mode of transportation is underutilized in many urban areas. Using a large-scale sample of commuters in Dublin, Ireland, the study offers insights into the psychological antecedents of bicycling adoption. The structural equation modeling results confirm the main premise of behavioral reasoning theory, in that reasons serve as important linkages between people's values and their attitudes and behavior. In particular, the findings suggest that commuters have reasons not to engage in bicycling (e.g., inconvenience, perceived danger), which account for most of the variance in bicycle-commuting behavior. The findings challenge interventions that emphasize the role of information campaigns and one-time infrastructural changes in encouraging voluntary change in travel behavior. Instead, the findings suggest that transportation planners and social marketers would be better off addressing consumers' reasons for and against bicycling through community-based initiatives. © 2014, American Marketing Association.",

The cueing of commonly performed ecological behaviors as environmentally friendly (what we call positive cueing) renders both cued and non-cued common ecological behaviors more diagnostic for the inference of pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1). As a result, positive cueing increases the likelihood that people will see themselves as consumers who are concerned with the degree to which their behavior is environmentally responsible (Study 2). The cueing of common ecological behaviors leads participants to choose environmentally friendly products with greater frequency, and even to use scrap paper more efficiently (Study 3).

    "Abstract": "Sustainability positioning is essential for firms that operate in highly competitive environments, as businesses are increasingly being evaluated in terms of their sustainable practices. Drawing upon social exchange theory, this study examines the role of trust as an underlying mechanism through which supplier B2B sustainability positioning influences buyer performance. A survey of 389 Australian B2B executives reveals the critical role of relational and competency trust in mediating the relationship between B2B sustainability positioning and buyer performance. However, industry-relevant factors such as transactional uncertainty and competitive intensity influence the mediating effects of trust in opposite directions. Specifically, competency trust has stronger mediating effects on buyer performance when there is lower transactional uncertainty and greater competitiveness. On the other hand, relational trust has stronger mediating effects on buyer performance when there is greater transactional uncertainty. The findings provide useful insights for firms wishing to leverage their sustainable image in order to appeal to prospective buyers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Consumers choosing between green and conventional products often believe such choices imply trade-off decisions, such that green products provide morally-related advantages but embody price or quality-related disadvantages compared to standard products. We study the consequences of such trade-offs for consumer value in the context of privately consumed green products. To develop our theoretical model, we draw from the perspective of self-signaling – consumers' act of signaling information about their internal qualities to their own self through choice. We explore how and when self-signals from such trade-off decisions influence consumer value gained from comparative choices of green versus standard products. Six studies were conducted, using divergent measures of the dependent variable, multiple product categories, and measured as well as manipulated self-concept clarity (SCC). We find a joint effect of self-signals from comparative choices and self-concept clarity on consumer value, such that positive self-signals lead to incrementally higher satisfaction and willingness to pay for consumers with low SCC but not significantly so for those with high SCC. Results show that this joint effect may occur for consumers with low SCC because they gain incremental value from perceived self-concept alignment – a state that is construed from the perception that a self-signal is aligned with the consumer's self-concept.

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between voluntary sustainability reporting and firm value, as measured by Tobin’s q. We test three main hypotheses developed from signaling theory and the sustainability reporting literature on a large panel of reporting and non-reporting organizations for the period 2011–2020. The results of a fixed effects panel model suggest that, in general, sustainability reporting is negatively related to Tobin’s q. However, the results also indicate that the relationship between sustainability reporting and Tobin’s q becomes increasingly positive over time. Our conclusion is that sustainability reporting is initially a costly signal, but that it eventually enhances firm value as companies learn how to better communicate sustainability initiatives to stakeholders and investors learn how to properly evaluate reports. Finally, in an analysis of sustainability reporting organizations, we find that external assurance is positively associated with Tobin’s q. External audits appear to increase the credibility of reports. Implications for marketing theory and practice are discussed. © 2022, Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Abstract": "This research identifies how choice of an eco-product (e.g., low-energy LED light bulbs, biodegradable paper towels) influences downstream, environmentally responsible behavior. Eco-product choice either reinforces or undermines subsequent environmentally responsible behavior, and this effect is contingent on individual consumers' preexisting environmental consciousness: among less environmentally conscious consumers, proenvironmental behavior is undermined; in contrast, highly environmentally conscious consumers display reinforcement of proenvironmental behavior. The authors reveal that these differential effects are driven by two discrete processes working in opposition: goal satiation drives licensing in the case of less environmentally conscious consumers, and prosocial self-perceptions drive reinforcement among highly conscious consumers. In addition, the authors identify a point-of-purchase intervention that mitigates the detrimental effects among less environmentally conscious consumers. Together, these results shed light on the downstream consequences of eco-product choice for consumers, with implications for the marketing and regulation of such products. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "In Study 1, the authors find that people are more satisfied with a service experience when they choose to participate in the provider's voluntary green program (e.g., recycling)-an effect mediated by the \"warm glow\" of participation. The downside, however, is that this same mechanism decreases satisfaction among people who choose not to participate. In Study 2, analysis of data from the J.D. PowerGuest Satisfaction Index suggests that incentivizing the program (i.e., compensating the program participants) paradoxically increases satisfaction for those who do not participate but decreases satisfaction among those who do. Studies 3 and 4 explore how manipulating incentive characteristics might enable managers to maximize satisfaction for both groups. Study 3 indicates that, compared with no incentive, an \"other-benefiting\" incentive increases warm glow and satisfaction for green program participants but decreases them among nonparticipants. Study 4, however, suggests that mixed incentive bundles (i.e., providing both self-benefiting and other-benefiting options)maximize warm glow and satisfaction for both groups-the ideal outcome for managers. © 2016, American Marketing Association.",

    "Method": "Field Survey",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "Marketing Letters",
    "Abstract": "To stimulate sales of sustainable products, such as organic and fair trade products, retailers need to know whether their in-store instruments effectively enhance market shares. This study uses sales data and a multilevel modeling approach to explain the market shares of sustainable products according to shelf layout factors, price level, price promotions, and consumer demographics. It argues that the effect of these variables differs between organic versus fair trade products, as buying motives might differ, organic buyers tend to be more loyal, and price is a more informative signal of quality for organic products. Results show that the number of facings has a positive relationship with the market share of fair trade brands, but not with the market share of organic brands. The same holds for the price difference with the leading brand, which is important for fair trade brands but not for organic brands. In contrast, an arrangement of the product category by brand is associated with higher market share for organic brands but not for fair trade brands. Additionally, placement at eye level and clustering of items benefits both types of sustainable brands, whereas they appear to be not very sensitive to price promotions. Finally, higher sales of sustainable products are found in areas where the customer base is older and has a higher education level. © 2011 The Author(s).",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present details of a large-scale experiment that evaluated the impact of communicating two types of feedback to householders regarding their domestic electricity consumption: feedback on their own consumption and feedback of both their own consumption and that of others in their locality. Design/methodology/approach: Digital technologies were used to automatically measure and communicate the electricity consumption of 316 UK residents for a period of 16 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: one involving no feedback; one involving feedback about a household's own usage, and one involving a household's own usage plus social norms feedback (the average consumption of others in the locality). At the end of the study, a selection of participants took part in interviews or focus groups. Findings: Both types of feedback (individual and individual-plus-social-norms) led to reductions in consumption of about 3 per cent. Those receiving social norms feedback were significantly more likely to engage with the information provided. However, the social norms information had no additional impact on consumption. Survey and interview data confirmed that participants from both conditions had been encouraged to adopt new energy-saving practices. The study concludes that near real-time individual feedback can be sufficient for usage reduction if it is provided in a historical format. It also suggests that the impact of social norms information may previously have been confounded with that of individual feedback. Originality/value: This is the first time that a controlled experiment in the field of domestic electricity consumption has compared the impact of real-time social norm information with that of information that only contains individual household usage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Some green consumers fail to follow through with planned environmental behaviors (EB), despite claiming intent to do so. The current research draws on reactance theory to shed light on this paradox at the intersection of environmentalism, sustainability, and green marketing. Historically, individuals have been conceptualized dichotomously as either pro or antienvironmental. Mann questions this simplistic perspective and introduces the “Wizard” and “Prophet” as environmentalist archetypes. Wizards and Prophets both engage in EB, but Wizards perceive science and technology as potential solutions, whereas Prophets believe consumption reduction is the only answer. Building upon self-discrepancy theory and using both qualitative and quantitative data, we find support for Mann's thesis that both environmentalist archetypes exist, and both have inclinations toward EB. Furthermore, these archetypes differ in how they respond to marketing messages or other external stimuli. Whereas Prophets are stimulated and increase EB when compelled to, Wizards react negatively resulting in decreased environmental behavior. Psychological reactance moderates the mediated effect of compulsion by magnifying the effect of this path. We propose that higher levels of reactance increase the positive impact of compulsion on Prophets while amplifying the negative effect of compulsion for Wizards. Exposing Wizards to marketing communications compelling environmentalism suppresses their EB. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",

Across six studies, we demonstrate that the six-item measure we develop (i.e., the GREEN scale) can be used to capture green consumption values in a reliable, valid, and parsimonious manner. We further theorize and empirically demonstrate that green consumption values are part of a larger nomological network associated with conservation of not just environmental resources but also personal financial and physical resources. Finally, we demonstrate that the GREEN scale predicts consumer preference for environmentally friendly products. In doing so, we demonstrate that stronger green consumption values increase preference for environmentally friendly products through more favorable evaluations of the non-environmental attributes of these products. These results have important implications for consumer responses to the growing number of environmentally friendly products. © 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.",

    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "Industrial Marketing Management",
    "Abstract": "Even though environmental values and sustainable branding have garnered much attention in the B2C context, B2B contexts remain relatively less explored. This study introduces a novel synthesis of Signaling theory and Stewardship theory and examines the moderating impact of brand governance on the relationship between green brand identity, consistent communication and channel partner commitment, leading to tactical green marketing orientation. Distinguishing itself from previous research, our approach embraces a multi-perspective lens, delving into the viewpoints of both channel partners and organizations (i.e., managers). Employing an explanatory sequential mixed method design, the first phase involved an empirical survey with 248 respondents (Study 1). Subsequently, the second phase (Study 2) comprised qualitative interviews with 41 respondents. The findings from both studies converged, revealing a positive association between “consistent communication” and “attitude,” a robust connection between “attitude” and “commitment,” and a favorable correlation between “green brand identity” and “attitude,” ultimately leading to a positive relationship between “attitude” and “green tactical marketing orientation\". This research significantly contributes to the comprehension of B2B green brand positioning by demonstrating, that in the B2B context, brand governance influences channel partners' commitment and tactical green marketing orientation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the interactive effects of a firm’s strategic sustainability orientation (SSO) and customer relationship capital (CRC) on sustainable product design practices (SPDP). Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the interactive effects of two firm resources, namely, SSO and CRC, as they relate to SPDP, using survey data from 132 manufacturers in Malaysia. Findings: The findings show that the effect of SSO on SPDP is stronger when CRC is low, than otherwise. The authors also find that the interactive effects of the firm-level resources stated above are stronger when customer pressures (CPs) are higher than when they are low. Research limitations/implications: The authors contribute to the literature by studying the effects of firm-level strategic resources and their interactions as they relate to SPDP. An important limitation of this research is the usage of single-source data and single-period data. Practical implications: Managerially, this research provides new insights into how organizations should respond to CPs while understanding the counterintuitive but disabling effects of customer relationship assets. Social implications: The findings are important to society because most of the environmental impact arising from the production, consumption and disposal of products is a direct consequence of decisions made at the product design stage and an unintended consequence of the marketing decision-making processes that underlie marketing strategy formulation that fails to recognize ecosystems impact as a standard decision influence. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first to study the effects of firm-level strategic resources and their interactions as they relate to SPDP. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "As concerns about pollution and climate change become more mainstream, the belief that shopping with reusable grocery bags is an important environmental and socially conscious choice has gained prevalence. In parallel, firms have joined policy makers in using a variety of initiatives to reduce the use of disposable plastic bags. However, little is known about how these initiatives might alter other elements of consumers' in-store behavior. Using scanner panel data from a single California location of a major grocery chain, and controlling for consumer heterogeneity, the authors demonstrate that bringing one's own bags increases purchases of not only environmentally friendly organic foods but also indulgent foods. They use experimental methods to further explore the expression of these effects and to consider the effects of potential moderators, including competing goals and store policies. The findings have implications for decisions related to product pricing, placement and assortment, store layout, and the choice of strategies employed to increase the use of reusable bags. © 2015, American Marketing Association.",

This study examined the underlying mechanism of message authenticity and product sustainability image in this relationship. This study also investigated the boundary condition of product type (utilitarian vs hedonic) in the effect of sustainability message appeal on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Four studies were carried out. One field experiment on Facebook and three scenario-based online experiments were conducted to test the proposed relationships. Findings: This study found that a concrete message appeal results in a higher purchase intention of the promoted product than an abstract message appeal.

    "Abstract": "The authors use panel data constructed from the responses of repeatedly surveyed top managers at 261 companies regarding their firm's market orientation, along with objective performance measures, to investigate the influence of market orientation on performance for a nine-year period from 1997 to 2005. The authors measure market orientation in 1997, 2001, and 2005 and estimate it in the interval between these measurement periods. The analyses indicate that market orientation has a positive effect on business performance in both the short and the long run. However, the sustained advantage in business performance from having a market orientation is greater for the firms that are early to develop a market orientation. These firms also gain more in sales and profit than firms that are late in developing a market orientation. Firms that adopt a market orientation may also realize additional benefit in the form of a lift in sales and profit due to a carryover effect. Market orientation should have a more pronounced effect on a firm's profit than sales because a market orientation focuses efforts on customer retention rather than on acquisition. Environmental turbulence and competitive intensity moderate the main effect of market orientation on business performance, but the moderating effects are greater in the 1990s than in the 2000s. © 2011, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "This research explores the characteristics of green influencer messages on follower engagement by examining the interplay between message framing (gain vs. loss), construal level (high vs. low), and post timing (weekdays vs. weekends). Green influencers (also: greenfluencers or sustainable influencers) are considered a key agent for a change to more sustainable consumption. A pilot field study of 1000 green influencers, however, indicates that the current communication practices of green influencers (which strongly focus on gain frames, low construal, and posts during the week) are not ideal for maximizing engagement and sustainable behavioral intentions. Two experiments replicate this finding and establish the process through which green influencer posts affect engagement: gain frames increase fluency, which increases engagement; low construal levels decrease psychological distance, which increases engagement. Timing moderates these processes in that weekend posts increase the engagement with gain frames and week posts increase the engagement with low-construal frames. These findings highlight that there is no silver bullet in green influencer messages, but that green influencers need to adapt the framing and construal of their messages to the posts' timing to increase their contribution to more sustainable lifestyles and the greater good. © 2024 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Previous studies have explored the relationship between positive emotions and individuals’ sustainable consumer behavior, but the results are inconsistent. Emotions with the same valence but different cognitive appraisals may have different effects on such behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effects of specific positive emotions on sustainable consumer behavior. Using a longitudinal survey and three experimental studies, this study tests the effect of gratitude on sustainable product choice and examines the underlying psychological mechanism. The results indicate that both trait and state gratitude increase individuals’ sustainable product choice. Furthermore, time discounting mediates the relationship between gratitude and sustainable product choice. Connectedness to the future self moderates the mediation process in the path from gratitude to sustainable product choice and in that from gratitude to time discounting. The findings enrich our understanding of the relationship between gratitude and sustainable product choice and provide marketers with tools to increase consumers’ sustainable product choice by incorporating a gratitude appeal into their marketing communications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",

    "Abstract": "The sharing economy represents an emerging technology-enabled socioeconomic system. Given its disruptive nature, the sharing economy not only challenges traditional marketing theories but also alters consumer norms and beliefs related to consumption concepts. Whether, when, and how the sharing economy transforms consumption remain important questions for managers to investigate. This study examines how sharing experiences influence consumers’ critical self-reflection and shape their intentions to re-engage in sharing practices. With data collected from two surveys and four experiments (including three pretests and one main study), we show that consumers’ perceived economic utility, social value, and sustainability potential in the sharing economy influence their intentions to re-engage in sharing practices, thus forming a loyal customer base. In addition, consumer reflexivity mediates this effect. We also show that past experience with business-to-consumer sharing practices moderates the proposed mediating effect. Overall, we demonstrate the disruptive impact of the sharing economy on individual consumers with meaningful managerial implications and contributions to marketing theories. © 2023, Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Abstract": "Growing concern about the sustainability of the natural environment is rapidly transforming the competitive landscape and forcing companies to explore the costs and benefits of \"greening\" their marketing mix. We develop and test a theoretical model that predicts (1) the role of green marketing programs in influencing firm performance, (2) the impact of slack resources and top management risk aversion on the deployment of such programs, and (3) the conditioning effects that underpin these relationships. Our analyses show that green marketing programs are being implemented by firms, and we find evidence of significant performance payoffs. Specifically the results indicate that green product and distribution programs positively affect firms' product-market performance, while green pricing and promotion practices are directly positively related to firms' return on assets. In addition, industry-level environmental reputation moderates the links between green marketing program components and firms' product-market and financial performance. Finally, we find that slack resources and top management risk aversion are independently conducive to the adoption of green marketing programs-but operate as substitutes for each other. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Abstract": "Manufacturers are increasingly producing and promoting sustainable products (i.e., products that have a positive social and/or environmental impact). However, relatively little is known about how product sustainability affects consumers' preferences. The authors propose that sustainability may not always be an asset, even if most consumers care about social and environmental issues. The degree to which sustainability enhances preference depends on the type of benefit consumers most value for the product category in question. In this research, the authors demonstrate that consumers associate higher product ethicality with gentleness-related attributes and lower product ethicality with strength-related attributes. As a consequence of these associations, the positive effect of product sustainability on consumer preferences is reduced when strength-related attributes are valued, sometimes even resulting in preferences for less sustainable product alternatives (i.e., the \"sustainability liability\"). Conversely, when gentleness-related attributes are valued, sustainability enhances preference. In addition, the authors show that the potential negative impact of sustainability on product preferences can be attenuated using explicit cues about product strength. © 2010, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Cryptocurrencies (cryptos) have detrimental environmental effects due to their massive energy consumption. While several green crypto coins have been launched, the mainstream—environmentally unfriendly coins—still lead the market. In this study, we explore if influencer marketing, specifically fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) appeals, can contribute to promoting green crypto coin purchases to encourage sustainable investments. The results of five studies (two lab experiments using neurobiological sensors, two online experiments, and a discrete choice experiment) show that social media postings conveying FOMO appeals decrease (increase) green crypto (normal crypto) coin investments. The results further show that message congruence and emotional value perceptions mediate this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed results hold when adding governance and regulatory crypto support as well as the crypto price path evolution to the choice. The results provide notable theoretical contributions and implications for policymakers concerned with fostering more sustainable consumption behavior in the crypto context. © 2024 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Consumers face marketing messages using social norms in many situations where different goals are dominant. This research examines moderating effects of regulatory focus for descriptive and injunctive norms in the promotion of sustainable products. More specifically, it shows that descriptive norms have a better fit with a promotion than prevention focus, while this is not the case for injunctive norms. Three experiments examine consequences for perceived message fluency, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Experiment 1 investigates regulatory focus when induced before a normative message, whereas Experiments 2 and 3 investigate regulatory elements ingrained in the message itself. Results show that messages with descriptive norms are perceived as more fluent and have a stronger impact on attitudes and intentions when promotion goals are salient than when prevention goals are salient. Unlike descriptive norms, injunctive norms are not affected by regulatory focus. Marketers using descriptive norms should develop message wording and context accordingly. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

    "Abstract": "People have substantially differing attitudes towards consumption. Anti-consumers are negative towards consumption. In contrast, pro-consumers view consumption in a positive light. We posit that people's attitudes toward consumption at the societal (macro) level are impacted by the implicit theories they hold about whether society can solve the problems it faces. We identify two different implicit theories consumers hold regarding how solvable larger societal problems are. Social optimists believe that we will solve the problems that are emerging as we evolve at the societal level. In contrast, social pessimists believe that societal evolution is creating problems too large to be solved. We developed a macro attitudes model where social optimism and pessimism were posited to impact people's macro attitudes towards consumption. We present the results of a study that found that social optimists have more positive attitudes towards consumption and social pessimists have more negative attitudes towards consumption. We also found that this model provided a superior fit in comparison to three other plausible models relating implicit theories and attitudes towards consumption. These findings have implications for anti-consumption research, consumer research on implicit theories, and social marketing designed to address problems associated with overconsumption. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This study, which includes respondents from the United States, Germany, and South Korea (total n = 1,018) who completed an online survey about usage of Facebook and Twitter, examines motives for sustainable behaviors. Kelman's (1958) functional motives, which correspond to the three major philosophies of psychology, were used as the theoretical foundation for this study. For all countries, involvement motives lead to recycling behaviors and green transportation use, but only for the United States and Germany do involvement motives lead to antimaterialistic views and organic food purchase. Collectivist South Korea has the highest level of social media involvement and of sustainable behaviors except in recycling, where Germany leads. Motives are complex, demanding careful analysis from advertisers who plan to deliver green advertisements over social media. © 2013 American Academy of Advertising.",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Marketers have begun to investigate the potential of gamification for influencing consumer behavior by using game design elements in realms varying from branding, retail, sales and health services. Marketers have also begun to explore consumer behavior in sustainability. This paper aims to provide contributions to build on both literatures. Design/methodology/approach: This research tests gamification principles in a large field study on real consumers that includes data from pre-post surveys, gamified app analytics and household energy meters. The data are analyzed using ANOVA’s and structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings demonstrate: gamification significantly enhanced consumers’ knowledge, attitudes, behavioral intentions and realized bill savings compared to a control group; reward-based game design elements including points, badges and other rewards contribute to enhancing sustainable behavior outcomes. Research limitations/implications: Future research in settings outside of sustainability may extend upon the findings of the current research to further understanding the impact of reward-based game design elements in marketing. Practical implications: The findings have important practical implications for how organizations might use serious games to promote sustainable and other desirable behavior. In particular, how reward-based game design elements, points, trophies and badges, can be used to create a chain of relationships that leads to reduced electricity consumption. Originality/value: This paper fulfills the need to understand if the impact of gamification extends outside of controlled environments and into the field. Further, it demonstrates how reward-based game design elements contribute to consumers changing their behavior, a relationship that is not yet thoroughly understood in the marketing literature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Source title": "Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science",
    "Abstract": "Despite widespread pro-green attitudes, consumers frequently purchase non-green alternatives. One possible explanation for this value-action gap is the tradeoffs that green products often force on their users: higher prices, lower quality, and/or reduced performance. The current study uses conjoint analysis to uncover the attribute preferences of car and TV buyers when green attributes are negatively correlated with conventional attributes. These attribute preferences are then used to predict choice among sets of green and less green alternatives currently sold in the marketplace. Strong preferences for green products are found when tradeoffs are not apparent, but preference shifts significantly to less green compromise alternatives when the actual attribute tradeoffs are considered. Although general preference is reduced by tradeoffs, a green product offering some compensatory advantage on a conventional attribute does attract a broader spectrum of consumers, while only \"dark green\" consumers are willing to pay the price to go green when the product offers few compensatory qualities. In all cases, however, predicted buyers of the greenest technologies offset some of their environmental benefits by choosing more energy-thirsty specifications on negatively correlated conventional attributes. Managerial and public policy implications of the findings are then discussed. © 2012 Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "PurposeThis paper aims to focus on the unique goal of understanding how marketing spending, a proxy for firm visibility, moderates the effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) strengths and concerns on stock returns in the short and long terms. In contrast to the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, the visibility theory, based on stakeholder awareness and expectations, offers asymmetric predictions on the moderation effects of marketing spending. Design/methodology/approachThe predictions are tested based on data from KLD, Compustat and Center for Research in Security Prices from 2001-2010 and panel data based regression models. FindingsTwo results support the predictions of the visibility theory over those of the RBV. First, strengths are associated with higher stock returns, for low marketing spending firms, and only in the long term. Second, concerns are associated with lower stock returns, for high marketing spending firms, also only in the long term. A profiling analysis indicates that high marketing spending firms have high R&D spending and are more likely to operate in business-to-customer than business-to-business industries. Practical implicationsThe two findings highlight the importance of coordination among chief marketing, sustainability and finance officers investing in CSR and marketing for stock returns, contingent on the firm’s marketing and R&D spending and industry characteristics. Originality/valueThis paper identifies conditions under which CSR is and is not related to stock returns, by uniquely considering three variables omitted in most past studies: marketing spending, CSR strengths and concerns and short- and long-term stock returns, all in the same study. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the potential health- and sustainability-related benefits of insect-based food products, many consumers do not perceive them as an alternative to conventional foods. This research provides a systematic approach to explain consumer reactions to insect-based food products conducting a series of multi-method studies involving implicit, self-reported, and actual behavioral responses to real insect-based food products (provided by a partner company). The authors investigate how product type (i.e., whether the insect-based food is utilitarian or hedonic in nature) and packaging characteristics (i.e., whether the image of a real or stylized insect is present on the front packaging or not) interact with consumer-related characteristics (i.e., health consciousness and food neophobia) to affect feelings of disgust, which in turn influence willingness to try insect-based food products. A distinctive feature of this research is that a partner company used the findings to change its marketing tactics and observed an improvement in its market performance. Our research has clear implications for marketing managers trying to overcome consumer resistance to eating insect-based foods, as well as retail managers considering marketing such food products. © 2022 New York University",

    "Abstract": "Color saturation—the color's purity and intensity (also known as vividness)—is a visual feature that has been under-investigated in the context of green marketing. To advance knowledge of this topic, we performed five experimental studies to confirm that consumers tend to unconsciously associate low color saturation with a product's “gentler” impact on the environment. This perception of eco-friendliness, in turn, increases their trust in the product maker's greenness. Our research disentangles the direct and indirect impact (via consumers' perceptions of materials' naturalness, product authenticity, and product durability) of low-saturation colors on the perceived eco-friendliness of consumer products. Furthermore, the results reveal that, by fostering perceptions of eco-friendliness and green trust, such colors favorably influence consumers' behavioral intentions (i.e., their purchase intention and intention to pay a premium price for the product). Ultimately, the paper provides useful insights for companies and marketers interested in leveraging the meaning of color saturation to elicit perceptions of environmental compatibility. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Globally, consumption of Fruit and Vegetables (F&V) remains below nutritional guidelines. With retailers accounting for a large portion of F&V sales, marketing can be key to increase F&V consumption at household level. However, a key challenge is the design of strategies that benefit retailers, e.g., improving loyalty, whilst promoting societal goals. This study evaluates a points-plus-cash loyalty program where participants received points by purchasing selected F&V, redeemable against a reward (plush toys in the shape of F&V). We estimate the impact of the program by comparing expenditures in several categories before, during, and after the promotional period, across two different years, and comparing consumers who redeemed a reward and those who did not. We use loyalty card data from a Croatian retailer, containing food expenditure in five categories for 268,359 consumers, over 27 weeks for 2 years. We find that the loyalty program increased F&V expenditures at the focal retailer during the promotional period. However, the increase was only for reward-redeemers, for whom the program increased expenditures in F&V as well as in other food categories. This effect persisted – at a declining rate – after the program stopped. Exposure only had a limited effect during the campaign, leading to a reduction in expenditure after the promotional period. Results indicate that a loyalty program promoting sales of F&V can create win-win benefits to both society and the retailer: it increases expenditures on healthy foods (F&V), while improving overall loyalty (i.e., expenditures) to the retailer amongst motivated consumers. © 2023 The Author(s)",

    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "The market share of brands positioned using ethical attributes typically lags behind brands that promote attributes related to product performance. Across four studies, the authors show that situational factors that heighten consumers' self-accountability (i.e., activation of their desire to live up to their self-standards) lead to increased preferences for products promoted through their ethical attributes. They investigate their predictions regarding selfaccountability in multiple ways, including examining the moderating roles of awareness of the discrepancy between a person's internal standards and actual behavior, self-accountability priming, and the presence of others in the decision context. Furthermore, they demonstrate that the subtle activation of self-accountability leads to more positive reactions to ethical appeals than explicit guilt appeals. Finally, they show that preference for a product promoted through ethical appeals is driven by the desire to avoid anticipated guilt, beyond the effects of impression management. Taken together, the results suggest that marketers positioning products through ethical attributes should subtly activate consumer self-accountability rather than using more explicit guilt appeals. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Tackling grand challenges and making sustainable development a reality through sustainable consumption crucially depends upon both companies’ activities as well as individuals’ consumption choices. In opinion polls, many consumers claim to favor sustainable products over conventional ones. However, a large gap remains between their stated purchasing intentions and actual decisions, posing a challenge for companies in predicting product demand and strategically managing their product portfolios. In this study, we develop a conceptual framework to demonstrate how companies can encourage sustainable consumption behavior among their customers by involving them in their corporate sustainability (CS) activities. We introduce psychological ownership as the underlying mechanism explaining how customer involvement in CS activities translates into changes in their consumption choices. We further argue that the link between customer involvement and psychological ownership depends on the type of a company’s CS—that is, whether CS is embedded in or peripheral to the company’s core business. The results from three experiments, including one field experiment conducted in collaboration with a fashion retailer and involving real customer purchase decisions, support our theorizing. The findings reveal the power of customer involvement as a marketing tool in promoting sustainable consumption. © The Author(s) 2024.",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: This work aims to use equity theory to explore how consumers assess prosocial actions as part of a mental portfolio of purchases and behaviors in a broader marketplace, seeking balance in market exchanges. Conceptualizing marketing exchange as both an exchange of perceived value and a balance between self- and collective-interest allows for segmentation by consumer sensitivity to equity and sheds light on why prosocial consumption might occur. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies validate and segment consumers via their equity sensitivity. Between-subject designs with samples of consumers and marketing managers validate an equity sensitivity index that segments how people balance self- and collective-interests in marketplace exchange and predicts prosocial consumption choices. Findings: The results indicate that Entitled decision makers are more willing to exchange collective-interest for self-interest and emphasize choices that maximize lower prices for consumers or greater profits for firms in lieu of prosocial outcomes. Benevolent decision makers, however, are more willing to exchange self-interest for collective-interest and support prosocial outcomes. Originality/value: This work moves beyond research that focuses on attitudes, values and situational factors, instead using equity theory to uncover broader marketplace motivations for prosocial consumption. The research reveals that a motivating force behind prosocial consumption is how much consumers perceive they have given to, and gotten, from, the marketplace. Segmenting the market according to how consumers balance gains and losses provides an alternate approach to studying prosocial consumption, as well as a practical approach to developing targeted marketing strategies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

Drawing upon recent research in the Industrial Marketing Management Sustainability Special Issue, this research investigates the impact of green initiatives on firm performance and how the related commitment of resources impacts the effectiveness of those initiatives. The goal of this paper is to explore the effectiveness of green marketing on firm performance, in terms of financial performance, market performance, and service quality. Further, resource commitment is examined as a possible boundary condition of these relationships. Using multi-source data, the findings suggest that the commitment of proper resources is critical to the success of any green initiative. This study also supports the notion that being the first firm in an industry to initiate a green program provides few tangible benefits. More importantly, even firms with an environmental focus neglect to realize superior performance unless the specific strategy is matched with consistent support from top management. © 2014.",

    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Emotional appraisal research has demonstrated that recalling a past behavior and its associated emotions can influence future behavior. However, how such recalled emotions shape sustainable consumer choice has not been examined. This study examines the role of recalled pride and guilt in shaping sustainable purchase intentions and the mediating role of anticipated pride and guilt. A conceptual model is proposed for motivating sustainable purchase intentions through the emotions associated with the behavioral recall. The model is applied in two experiments with online consumers examining purchase intentions of low carbon cars. Recalling feelings of pride associated with a past sustainability-related behavior increases sustainable purchase intention, as compared with a neutral recall. This effect occurs through the mediation of both anticipated pride at the prospect of a sustainable behavior choice and anticipated guilt if the future choice is not sustainable. Similar hypotheses relating to recalled guilt at past unsustainable behavior were not supported. The study contributes to research on sustainable consumption, revealing an emotional route by which past behavior can influence future behavior. It also adds to emotional appraisal research by showing the role of specific self-conscious emotions in forming this route, as prior research has focused more broadly on emotional valence. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

This paper identifies, theorizes, and empirically validates the differential roles of board oversight and incentivization, along with contingencies (a chief marketing officer’s (CMO) presence and governance disclosure), in driving CE and SE. Using data from 308 firms, the paper finds that while board oversight and incentivization positively affect CE, only incentivization positively affects SE. The paper also finds significant moderation effects of CMO presence and governance disclosure. Through multiple post hoc analyses, the paper explores how CE and SE influence firm performance.

    "Abstract": "The authors propose that purchasing luxury can be a unique means to engage in sustainable consumption because high-end products are particularly durable. Six studies examine the sustainability of high-end products, investigate consumers’ decision making when considering high-end versus ordinary goods, and identify effective marketing strategies to emphasize product durability, an important and valued dimension of sustainable consumption. Real-world data on new and secondhand accessories demonstrate that high-end goods can be more sustainable than mid-range products because they have a longer life cycle. Furthermore, consumers engage in more sustainable behaviors with high-end goods, owning them for longer and disposing of them in more environmentally friendly manners. Nevertheless, many consumers prefer to concentrate their budget on multiple ordinary goods in lieu of fewer high-end products partly because of product durability neglect, a failure to consider how long a product will last. Although consumers generally believe that high-end products last longer, they fail to take such a notion into account when making purchases. Finally, this research offers actionable strategies for marketers to help consumers overcome product durability neglect and nudge them toward concentrating their budget on fewer high-end, durable products. © American Marketing Association 2021.",

We assess the moderating effect of global cultural identity on the relationship between materialism and environmentally friendly tendencies using three different conceptualizations and measures of global cultural identity - the lifestyle and brand dimensions of global consumption orientation and global connectedness. In emerging markets, we observe strong positive effects of materialism on the concern for environmentally friendly products, the willingness to pay extra for environmentally friendly products, perceptions of global companies as environmentally friendly, and the likelihood to engage in environmentally friendly tendencies for the global segment across all three conceptualizations of global cultural identity; in addition, for individuals with a glocal cultural identity, we observe a significant positive relationship between materialism and these measures of environmentally friendly tendencies. In developed markets, significant effects are observed only for the global segment, but specific effects depend on the conceptualization of a global cultural identity. Therefore, our results indicate that multinational companies focused on combining materialistic appeals with their green positioning in the emerging markets must carefully target consumers with a strong global cultural identity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Abstract": "Firms often emphasize “green” benefits for products that are only partially more sustainable than alternatives (e.g., a more sustainable packaging with similar product ingredients). The current article posits that such strategies can lead to a perceived claim–fact discrepancy and examines to what extent this makes consumers feel deceived and detracts from attitudes and purchase intentions, even though consumers can intrinsically value the (partial) sustainability improvements. In addition, given that marketing communication often relies on puffery such as exaggerated language and (visual) hyperbole, the article also investigates the effect of the use of puffery versus more subdued claims. Findings from two experiments unveil that when the actual sustainability of packaged products is (partially) discrepant with an overt sustainability claim, this leads to higher perceived deception. The use of puffery has both pros and cons, such that it adds to perceived sustainability but also to perceived deception, and it moderates the effects of actual sustainability. Furthermore, the results provide initial support for the idea that sustainability improvements in only peripheral attributes (packaging) are perceived as more deceptive than sustainability improvements in only central attributes (product contents). © 2022 The Author(s).

    "Abstract": "Packaging waste makes up more than 10% of the landfilled waste in the United States. While consumers often want to make environmentally friendly product choices, we find that their perceptions of the environmental friendliness of product packaging may systematically deviate from its objective environmental friendliness. Eight studies (N = 4,103) document the perceived environmental friendliness (PEF) bias whereby consumers judge plastic packaging with additional paper to be more environmentally friendly than identical plastic packaging without the paper. The PEF bias is driven by consumers' \"paper = good, plastic = bad\"beliefs and by proportional reasoning, wherein packaging with a greater paper-to-plastic proportion is judged as more environmentally friendly. We further show that the PEF bias impacts consumers' willingness to pay and product choice. Importantly, this bias can be mitigated by a \"minimal packaging sticker\"intervention, which increases the environmental friendliness perceptions of plastic-only packaging, rendering plastic-packaged products to be preferable to their plastic-plus-paper-packaged counterparts. This research contributes to the packaging literature in marketing and to research on sustainability while offering practical implications for managers and public policy officials.  © 2023 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Embarrassment plays a pivotal role in the consumer landscape by significantly influencing consumers' purchase and consumption experiences. While marketing scholarship has primarily focused on the undesirable facets of embarrassment, the present research examines the positive outcomes of embarrassment for consumers, firms, and the environment. Based on costly signaling theory, this research seeks to determine the effect of embarrassment on consumer preferences toward prosocial products. Using six experimental studies (including one in the Supporting Information: Appendix), we demonstrate that embarrassment positively influences the purchase intention for environment-friendly and sustainable products. Using lab and consequential studies, we show that the motivation to repair the social image mediates the effect of embarrassment on prosocial product preference. We also identify that public self-consciousness moderates this effect, such that embarrassed individuals with high (vs. low) public self-consciousness exhibit higher prosocial product preference. We also show that our core predictions on the effect of embarrassment on prosocial products is contingent upon the social context, such that embarrassment leads to enhanced intentions to repair social image and prosocial product preference in public but not in private purchase context. The results hold for various product categories. The findings contribute to a greater theoretical understanding of embarrassment by revealing a prosocial facet of the phenomenon. © 2024 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine whether consumers demonstrate a multi-dimensional understanding of sustainability in their decision-making and addresses the situational influence of confidence and compromise on sustainable product choices. Design/methodology/approach: Using three choice-based conjoint experiments the authors examined the importance of sustainability, compromise and confidence to consumers across two contexts. Two-step cluster analyses were used to segment consumers based on the importance scores. Findings: Data indicates that the environmental dimension of sustainability is the most influential followed by economic and social. The responses suggest three distinct segments identified as self-focused, trend motivated and reality driven that demonstrate significantly different characteristics in their approach to sustainable products. Research limitations/implications: Current research tends to focus on the environmental dimension, while paying little heed to the economic and social dimensions. This research indicates that consumers consider all three dimensions when making sustainable product choices and highlights that differences may emerge with respect to product utility. Practical implications: Firms must be aware that consumers differ in the importance they place on sustainability. The reality-driven segment is the most attractive segment, as they are highly engaged and are willing to invest time in understanding the complexities of sustainability. The trend-motivated segments are more fickle with superficial knowledge, and the self-focused segments are self-serving in their orientations and use price as a key decision variable. Originality/value: The paper addresses an important oversight in the sustainability literature. It provides both a theoretical contribution to advance marketing research and a practical contribution that may be of interest to those trying to market sustainable products. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Can moral associations linked with food products harm hedonic consumption experience? Across four studies, we show that moral associations linked to food that clash with values (racism and animal welfare) held by today's ethical consumers can engender moral disgust, which in turn undermines both expected and actual taste experience. The studies contribute to the literature by showing that associations impact consumption experience even in the absence of concrete actions, and by revealing moral disgust as the mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Importantly, this effect was observed even when the moral associations involved racism or sustainability (e.g., animal welfare), which have no direct relationship to product quality. This reveals that mere moral associations, rather than quality associations, influence hedonic consumption experience, rather than quality associations. More broadly, the findings point to the ways in which extrinsic attributes affect product experience and evaluation, particularly in hedonic consumption. This may be particularly impactful for values clashing with those championed by ethical consumers. From a practical perspective, these studies provide a broader perspective on corporate social responsibility by showing that companies should exercise caution when exploiting the moral associations linked to their products. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper aims to examine to what extent congruity between ethical attributes (i.e. product attributes with positive implications for the environment, human rights, social issues and animal welfare) and brand concept (i.e. the unique meaning associated with a brand in consumers’ minds) influences consumers’ evaluations of brands offering ethical attributes. Design/methodology/approach: Four studies involving North American consumers empirically tested the moderation effect of brand concept on consumer evaluations of ethical attributes and the mediating role of perceived congruity. Findings: This research finds an interactive effect of ethical attribute type and brand concept on brand evaluations, such that congruent ethical attribute–brand concept pairings (i.e. a utilitarian [symbolic] ethical attribute offered by a brand with a utilitarian [symbolic] brand concept) result in more favorable brand evaluations (Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4). Consumers’ perceptions of congruity between ethical attributes and brand concepts mediate this interactive effect (Studies 2 and 3). Moreover, a positive congruity effect of ethical attributes and brand concepts emerges at higher levels of conspicuous brand consumption (Study 4). Research limitations/implications: It is important to acknowledge that the current research did not specifically consider the case of utilitarian and symbolic ethical attribute offerings by luxury brands. This is a question that is left to future investigations. Practical implications: For marketing managers, findings indicate that brands gain from ethical attribute introductions only when these attributes are congruent with the brand concept. In addition, brands benefit to a greater extent from offering congruent ethical attributes when brand consumption is conspicuous. Originality/value: The findings of this research contribute to the literature on the effect of ethical attributes on consumers’ responses to brands and highlight the importance of brands’ choice of ethical attributes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "The present research addresses the gap in studies on B2B marketing comparing a diverse set of socio-economic factors (ROA and Tobin’ s Q) and its effects on people, planet, and profit. Studies in the past have shown that firms haven't been able to gain a long-term competitive advantage by using environmental strategies. Hence, the research analyses how 371 B2B firms from developed and emerging European countries achieve competitive advantage through green marketing strategies. Additionally, those firms are also assessed in reference to their level of engagement with environmental, social, and governance strategies. Our findings highlight that the more the engagement in green marketing by B2B firms, the greater the green competitive advantage that B2B firms in developed European markets can achieve. Hence, the study explores the relationship of B2B marketing, environmental sustainability, and corporate profitability, providing insights into how European firms can balance their financial objectives with their social and environmental responsibilities. The originality of the research stressed the need to pursue social and environmental goals and to preserve the future of people, planet, and profit through green marketing strategies.

    "Abstract": "This research explores consumer reactions following green product failures, identifying a novel benefit for companies selling environmentally friendly products. Across an empirical field analysis and eight controlled experiments, the authors show that consumers react less negatively to the failure of green products than conventional ones, which is referred to as the greenguard effect. The findings suggest that by not reacting negatively to green product failures, consumers believe they are being more prosocial, as their negative reaction may harm the success of a product that otherwise benefits the environment and society. This research contributes to the literature on green products by highlighting a novel benefit of green product attributes and demonstrating how prosocial motives influence consumer reactions to green product failures, and offers valuable insights for marketers on green product marketing. © 2023, Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Abstract": "Recently issued United Nations Sustainable Development Goals call for people to make extensive behavioral changes, including consuming food more sustainably. The authors explore the role that meso-level retailers play in local purchasing, an activity that the United Nations recognizes as a contributor to sustainability. In so doing, the authors promote more balance within the marketing literature, which has focused more on the environmental component of products and purchasing and less on the local dimension. This article spotlights “soft” policies, those that use persuasion and encourage voluntary action, rather than direct methods, such as subsidies and regulations. The authors develop a core hypothesis about how social norm messages and attitudes toward local food affect consumer purchase intentions. They test this hypothesis across national contexts via online surveys of 316 Italian consumers (Study 1) and 186 U.S. consumers (Study 2). The analysis reveals that in both countries, the effectiveness of social norm messages increases with unfavorable attitudes toward local buying. The study concludes with thoughts for researchers and policy makers about how meso-level actors, such as retailers, can elicit more local purchasing. © 2018, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Brand activism, i.e., taking a public stance towards sociopolitical issues, is a controversial strategic marketing tool for firms. Prior work shows that at best, it has no significant positive impact on consumer support and outcomes for brands. In this research, we propose and explore how advice-giving impacts consumer brand activism support and brand liking. Across four studies we find that advice-giving leads to more successful brand activism by increasing brand activism support behavior, and also has benefits for the brand. We show that advice-giving drives higher levels of normative influence which leads to higher brand activism support behavior. We also study a boundary condition and show that even when brands do not follow consumers’ advice, advice-giving has no negative behavioral and attitudinal consequences for the brand. Overall, we contribute to literature on brand activism and advice-giving and help marketers in strategically and effectively designing their brand activism activities. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "One of the main challenges in social entrepreneurship is capturing stakeholder support-from consumers, to legislators, to volunteers, to many others. Identifying likely supporters is the first step to sustainable success, but a difficult one. This research examines whether personality influences a person's tendency to support innovative social entrepreneurial (SE) ventures. Here, the possible influence of the \"Big Five\" personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism [OCEAN]) is examined; however, in line with prior research, attention is focused on both openness (an OCEAN trait) and empathy (a non-OCEAN trait). Two types of SE ventures are considered: social innovations and technological innovations. Data from a survey evaluating six SE ventures (three social and three technological) reveal that participants' personality influences support; however, observed influence differs by type of venture-openness underlies support of technological innovations, and empathy underlies support of social innovations. Further process analysis demonstrates that this influence is not direct but rather is mediated by people's perceptions of how much change the venture will make. These results offer social entrepreneurs insights into who might be prone to support SE ventures and, more important, why. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Firms can save considerable money if consumers conserve resources (e.g., if hotel patrons turn off the lights when leaving the room, if restaurant patrons use fewer paper napkins, if airline passengers clean up after themselves). In two studies conducted in real-world hotels, the authors show that consumers' conservation behavior is affected by the extent to which consumers perceive the firm as being green. Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers' conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer, and the environment. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",

    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Virtual influencers have great potential to shape the audience's perception and motivate behavioral change. Drawing upon anthropomorphism theory and social identity theory, this paper examined the interaction effect of anthropomorphism and racial homophily of virtual influencers in shaping audiences' trust and subsequently pro-environmental behaviors in low- and high-cost contexts. Two online studies employing experimental materials generated by artificial intelligence were conducted. Study 1 revealed that high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) and high racial homophily (local-like virtual influencers) are more effective for eliciting trust in the context of low-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings also showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) would further weaken the trust level of a virtual influencer in low anthropomorphism (animate-like virtual influencers). Study 2 aimed to replicate the findings from Study 1 in the context of high-cost pro-environmental behaviors. The findings showed that low racial homophily (foreign-like virtual influencers) enhanced the trust in a high anthropomorphism (human-like virtual influencers) virtual influencer. The moderated mediation analyses confirmed the hypothesized relationships in the proposed research model. This research advanced our understanding on the moderating role of racial homophily that serves as a cognitive shortcut for low-cost and quick decisions. However, a low racial homophily (foreign-like) virtual influencer would be more effective for high-cost and symbolic pro-environmental behaviors. These insights provide valuable guidance to businesses, marketers, and environmental advocates aiming to leverage virtual influencers for encouraging sustainability practices. © 2024 The Authors.

With a joint motive, a brand can highlight how an effort can benefit both planet and business with a “doing well by doing good” approach. Across five experiments, including a field study on Facebook, this research investigates the positive impact of the joint motive and its ability to enhance the credibility of sustainable initiatives via heightened perceptions of trustworthiness and expertise.

    "Abstract": "As sustainability trends gain momentum, more businesses seek to expand their green business portfolios by acquiring firms with green technologies or green brands. However, the financial impact of this green marketing strategy is unclear. Utilizing event study methodology and the two-stage Heckman selection model, this study investigates stock market valuations of 182 announcements about green acquisitions from US public firms between 2000 and 2018. We report several interesting findings. First, we find that green acquisitions are accompanied by positive stock market reactions. Second, the stock market reacts more favorably to acquirers with a higher level of marketing capability and a lower level of innovation capability when green acquisitions are announced. Third, industry sensitivity moderates the effects of the two aforementioned organizational capabilities on the stock market return−green acquisition relationship. We gain insight into investor responses in the context of green acquisitions through the lens of marketing and innovation capabilities. The findings enrich research in the domain of marketing−finance interface and sustainability marketing by shedding light on the short-term green acquisition–firm value relationship. © 2023",

    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Abstract": "Despite investigating digital gaming for commercial purposes, less scholarly attention exists on digital gaming for societal purposes such as sustainability (“serious games”). The current study investigates whether a serious game can enhance sustainability marketing outcomes, including knowledge, value-in-behavior, and behavioral intentions longitudinally (pre-gameplay to post-gameplay). Further, the study seeks to understand the influence of reward-based and meaningful game mechanics on these sustainability marketing outcomes. We recruited 387 participants for a week-long field study using a serious game which encourages household energy conservation. The findings show that the serious game significantly increased sustainability knowledge, value-in-behavior, and sustainable behavioral intention after one week. Reward-based game mechanics (badges and trophies) significantly influenced sustainability knowledge and indirectly influenced value-in-behavior via sustainability knowledge, whereas reward-based (points) and meaningful (educational messages) game mechanics had little impact. The results empirically support the conceptual model theorization—underpinned by a “do–learn–feel” behavioral learning approach—which possessed superior fit to a “do–feel–learn” rival model. This study provides novel insights regarding eliciting value-in-behavior longitudinally within serious games. Our multidimensional approach to assessing reward-based game mechanics extends prior studies and suggests that higher-tier rewards are more influential than lower-tiered rewards to achieve sustainability marketing outcomes. We further demonstrate that reward-based game mechanics outperform meaningful game mechanics at influencing desired outcomes, challenging existing gaming literature. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",

    "Abstract": "The authors explore how injunctive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others think one should do), descriptive appeals (i.e., highlighting what others are doing), and benefit appeals (i.e., highlighting the benefits of the action) can encourage consumers to engage in relatively unfamiliar sustainable behaviors such as \"grasscycling\" and composting. Across one field study and three laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of the appeal type depends on whether the individual or collective level of the self is activated. When the collective level of self is activated, injunctive and descriptive normative appeals are most effective, whereas benefit appeals are less effective in encouraging sustainable behaviors. When the individual level of self is activated, self-benefit and descriptive appeals are particularly effective. The positive effects of descriptive appeals for the individual self are related to the informational benefits that such appeals can provide. The authors propose a goal-compatibility mechanism for these results and find that a match of congruent goals leads to the most positive consumer responses. They conclude with a discussion of implications for consumers, marketers, and public policy makers. © 2013, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Can low-cost marketing tools that are used to enhance business performance also contribute to creating a better world? The authors investigate the role of online social media tools in alleviating customer (farmer) uncertainty and promoting the adoption of a new eco-friendly pesticide in rural China via a randomized controlled field experiment. The key finding is that even for a new product such as a pesticide, a low-cost social media support platform can effectively promote adoption. A combination of information from peers and from the firm on the platform facilitates learning about product features and alleviates uncertainty associated with product quality and appropriate product usage. Nevertheless, at the trial stage of the funnel, the platform underperforms the firm’s customized one-on-one support because available information does not resolve uncertainty in supplier credibility and product authenticity. Having an influencer on the platform, albeit not an expert on this product, vouching for its credibility helps resolve this funnel-holdup problem. From a theoretical perspective, this paper provides suggestive evidence for referent influence and credibility signaling on social media platforms and consequences for new product trial. The authors also provide direct empirical evidence on how information facilitates learning, a phenomenon typically assumed to be present in studies estimating learning models. © The Author(s) 2021.",

    "Abstract": "This research shows that consumers who willfully ignore ethical product attributes denigrate other, more ethical consumers who seek out and use this information in making purchase decisions. Across three studies, willfully ignorant consumers negatively judge ethical others they have never met across various disparate personality traits (e.g., fashionable, boring). The denigration arises from the self-threat inherent in negative social comparison with others who acted ethically instead of choosing not to do so. In addition, this denigration has detrimental downstream consequences, undermining the denigrator's commitment to ethical values, as evidenced by reduced anger toward firms who violate the ethical principle in question and reduced intention to behave ethically in the future. There are two moderators of the effect: Denigration becomes less strong if willfully ignorant consumers have a second opportunity to act ethically after initially ignoring the ethical product information and also significantly weakens if initially ignoring the ethical attribute is seen as justifiable. These results have implications for understanding ethical consumption behavior, perceptions of ethical consumerism in general, and marketing of ethical products. © 2015 Society for Consumer Psychology.",

    "Abstract": "There is a consensus to promote green consumption to drive sustainable human development and high-quality economic development. It is therefore essential for academics, policymakers, and marketers to understand the factors that influence green consumption. Through four experiments, this study examines the effect of financial scarcity—a feeling commonly experienced by consumers—on green consumption. These experiments show that financial scarcity can hinder consumers' choice of green products. The above process occurs because the scarcity of monetary resources induces anxiety, which in turn reduces self-efficacy. We further find that the observed effect will be attenuated when consumers' social support level is high (vs. low). These findings demonstrate that the impact of financial scarcity on green consumption is mediated by anxiety and self-efficacy perception and moderated by social support.

In this context, carbon carbon credits have emerged as a carbon offsetting mechanism to help organizations invest in low-carbon initiatives. However, existing studies are yet to examine whether carbon offsetting practices will influence the sustainability behavior of B2B organizations and whether it could lead to greenwashing propensity. In this vein, we adopt agency and revealed pereferences theories to conduct two experiments with B2B small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) managers operating in the UK process intensive sectors to reveal that affordability of carbon credits can motivate managers to engage in sustainable attitudes and practices. We also found that organizations willing to buy carbon credits at high price to are likely to engage in high greenwashing propensity. Considering these novel findings, we provide recommendations that will help organizations to become more responsible in their carbon offesteing investments, and for policy makers to adopt stringent assessment of such investments and carbon disclosures made by firms. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This study tackles the issue of how consumers might perceive luxury products' sustainability-focused communication. We compare consumers' reactions when luxury brands communicate their focus on either product sustainability or product excellence (i.e., a sustainability- vs. excellence-focused communication strategy, respectively). We predict that consumers perceive the former as more atypical for a luxury brand, which renders the communication more effective at enhancing consumers' willingness to buy the brand's products. Across six experiments, we demonstrate that perceived atypicality mediates the effect of luxury product communication strategy on consumers' willingness to buy; that perceived atypicality increases willingness to buy by increasing consumers' perception about the uniqueness of the communication strategy; that the effect of perceived atypicality is stronger for consumers with a higher chronic need for uniqueness; and that the greater effectiveness of a sustainability-focused communication strategy on atypicality and willingness to buy is peculiar to luxury products (i.e., it does not manifest for mass-market products). From a managerial perspective, our findings demonstrate that luxury brands may innovate their communication strategies by leveraging sustainability rather than product excellence. © 2021 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "This research investigates consumers' reactions to luxury versus mass-market fashion products that are produced in an unsustainable manner. In particular, this research empirically assesses whether and why third-party information revealing the unsustainable nature of luxury versus mass-market fashion products may increase consumers' intention to engage in negative word-of-mouth about the manufacturing company. The results of four experiments demonstrate that, when confronted with information revealing that a purchased luxury fashion product has been produced in an environmentally or socially unsustainable manner, consumers experience a higher sense of guilt over that product, compared to a purchased mass-market fashion product, due to their lower expectations about luxury fashion products' unsustainability. Guilt, in turn, drives consumers' intention to generate negative word-of-mouth about the producer and such an effect is more pronounced among consumers with a higher versus lower individualistic orientation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: This paper investigates why and when messages regarding unsustainable luxury products lead to negative word-of-mouth (NWOM) through a focus on the role of guilt, need to warn others and consumers' cultural orientation. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments test whether messages describing unsustainable versus sustainable luxury manufacturing processes elicit guilt and a need to warn others and whether and how the need to warn others affects consumers' NWOM depending on their cultural orientation. Findings: Consumers experience guilt in response to messages emphasizing the unsustainable (vs sustainable) nature of luxury products. In turn, guilt triggers a need to warn other consumers, which leads to NWOM about the luxury company. Furthermore, the results suggest that two dimensions of Hofstede's model of national culture – namely individualism/collectivism and masculinity/femininity – moderate the effect of the need to warn others on NWOM. Practical implications: Luxury managers should design appropriate strategies to cope with consumers' different reactions to information regarding luxury brands' unsustainability. Managers should be aware that the risk of NWOM diffusion may be higher in countries characterized by a collectivistic and feminine orientation rather than an individualistic and masculine orientation. Originality/value: Consumer reaction to unsustainable luxury, especially across different cultural groups, is a neglected area of investigation. This work contributes to this novel area of research by investigating NWOM stemming from unsustainable luxury manufacturing practices in different cultural contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Method": "Field Experiment",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2023",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how decision-makers can enhance citizens’ sustainable disposal of e-waste through bin proximity and ad hoc communication. Specifically, the authors discuss a two-year research project that took place in Northern Italy, where the authors documented the number of products disposed of sustainably in four towns. Design/methodology/approach: The project involved five main groups of stakeholders: i) four municipalities, ii) one social purpose organisation employing people with disabilities, (i.e. Andromeda), iii) one provider of bins (i.e. PubliCittà), iv) another social purpose organisation entity (i.e. Fondazione CRT) and v) the University of Portsmouth. After conducting three online pilot tests to confirm expectations of this study regarding how to enhance citizens’ sustainable disposal of e-waste, the authors have implemented the field pilot programme in a small municipality and successively in other three towns. Finally, the authors measured the impact of the programme on the actual recycling rate of citizens in the three target municipalities. Findings: The authors found that the positioning of drop-off bins in such a way as to reduce the distance from as many households as possible, along with the use of communication that facilitates the understanding of information related to sustainable disposal schemes, can improve the sustainable behaviour of citizens. The sustainable disposal of exhausted batteries after the intervention improved by 135% on average in the three municipalities that adopted the disposal scheme (Saluggia, San Benigno Canavese and Santhiá). The disposal rate of toners and electronics increased by 204.0% and 318.75% (San Benigno Canavese) and 138.7% and 85.4% (Santhiá), respectively. Research limitations/implications: The authors believe it would be cautious to consider potential differences in terms of recycling cultures and facilities before implementing the programme in other countries. Practical implications: The authors’ contribution shows decision-makers how to effectively design disposal schemes to enhance citizens' sustainable behaviour. The authors demonstrate how the thoughtful and responsible use of marketing levers can affect environmental sustainability and impact social development. Social implications: This paper has an actual impact on society by changing citizens’ behaviour, reducing harm to the environment and human well-being and supporting the inclusion of disadvantaged people in sustainability-oriented programmes. Originality/value: The structured and equitable engagement of scholars with multiple stakeholders can lead to the co-creation of societal value and knowledge and improve the well-being of multiple stakeholders. The collaboration between academics and practitioners enables the definition of effective strategies by observing the actual behaviour of individuals (i.e. citizens) and offers a direct and measurable impact on society. The involvement of social purpose organisations reinforces the shared primary aim of achieving measurable social and environmental impact. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "This research explores the feelings of guilt and pride experienced by consumers after a purchase decision that involves issues of environmental and social sustainability. Through a multi-method design, the authors examine key dimensions that influence the process of emotional appraisal, illustrate the characteristics of appraisals of guilt/pride and investigate the consequences that emotions have on future choices. In this exploratory research, when a purchase decision includes an ethical dilemma, consumers were found to express guilt or pride even when the purchase is not intentional, i.e. forced by circumstances. Moreover, the study explores how emotions experienced after decisions may have a positive influence on the future purchase of sustainable alternatives. Finally, the paper proposes a new model that describes the process of emotional appraisal and reports on a number of dimensions that were found to lead to guilt and pride. The insights presented extend knowledge of two key consumer emotions and present important implications for practitioners promoting ethical products. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

We present the first research to examine how product self-creation affects the individual’s consumption experience of such products and their well-being. Seven field and lab studies provide evidence that when consumers self-create a product, they appreciate it to a greater degree, are likely to consume it more mindfully, and experience greater domain-specific and general well-being. The individual’s private self-consciousness strengthens the effect. Self-creating products offers consumers with a practical, versatile, and personal interest-driven way to transcend their traditional role, to consume more consciously and sustainably, while concurrently enhancing the enjoyment of their consumption experience. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

The effectiveness of CSR is also shown to vary as a function of company motives and CSR framing, serving as theoretically and managerially relevant boundary conditions.

    "Year": "2022",
    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to examine how and when narcissism and faith in humanity simultaneously influence product reuse. Despite its critical role in promoting sustainability, scholars have paid scant attention to product reuse as a reliable aspect of sustainable consumer behavior. Moreover, research on personality traits as drivers of sustainable consumption has mostly focused on the Big Five personality traits. We posit that the effects of consumers' narcissism and faith in humanity on product reuse are explained by social exclusion and are conditional on subjective norms. We test our hypotheses using two experiments and three cross-sectional surveys. We find that while narcissism has a negative effect on product reuse, faith in humanity has a positive effect on product reuse. We also observe that social exclusion mediates the effects of narcissism and faith in humanity, and that subjective norms positively moderate the relationships between narcissism and product reuse. This study highlights the importance of product reuse as a key indicator of sustainable consumption and offers novel insights into the how and when consumers engage in product reuse. © 2022 The Authors.

This paper deepens the understanding of gamification-based and non-gamification-based OC influence on innovation capability and environmental and organizational marketing performance through the theory of organizational creativity and the theory of administrative behavior (AB). Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect data from firms that abide by the ISO 14091 certifications to ensure the proper quality standards. Primary data from 384 firms are used to test the hypotheses. The results would help firms invest in technological solutions by practicing creativity over time. Additionally, the study helps explore how AB is critical in steering technological creativity for making firms climate-conscious. Findings: The study's findings identified that OC has a positive influence on technological innovation capabilities and environmental innovation capabilities. Technological innovation capabilities have a beneficial impact on environmental sustainability. Environmental sustainability appears to have a substantial correlation with technological innovation skills. Environmental innovation capabilities positively impact environmental sustainability and organizational marketing performance. A moderating effect of gamification on the international dynamic capabilities within a relationship between organizational culture and environmental innovation capabilities exists.

It investigates how social norms, self-control, conspicuousness and future orientation shape sustainable luxury consumption in individualistic (UK) versus collectivist (China) national cultures. Design/methodology/approach: The study was based on survey data from British and Chinese luxury product consumers collected through online panels. The final sample included 452 valid responses from the UK and 414 from China. Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. Findings: The study found that descriptive norms positively influence sustainable luxury consumption in individualistic (UK) and collectivist (China) cultures. Injunctive norms affect sustainable consumption only in the UK. Future consequences universally impact sustainable consumption. Conspicuous consumption negatively affects preferences for sustainable luxury brands. Self-control enhances the impact of descriptive norms in the UK but reduces the impact of injunctive norms in China. Originality/value: This study uniquely explores how social norms and cultural influences impact sustainable luxury consumption in individualistic and collectivistic societies. It highlights the moderating role of national culture, providing actionable insights for luxury brands to enhance sustainable consumption with culturally tailored strategies.

    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2014",
    "Abstract": "Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the influence of consumer reviews on the evaluation, post-experience, of products with a combination of sustainable, hedonic and utilitarian properties. Design/methodology/approach - In the first instance, consumer reviews for organic and non-organic cosmetics posted on the French Web site beauté-test.com were analyzed. Second, a full-factorial two product types (organic and non-organic) x three reviews (positive, negative and no reviews) experiment was conducted. Sixty French women tested a beauty product and evaluated it on hedonic and utilitarian (ambiguous and non-ambiguous) properties. In a second experiment, 132 English-speaking students evaluated an herbal tea at home, along a full-factorial two product types (fair-trade and non-fair-trade) x three product properties (hedonic, utilitarian ambiguous and utilitarian non-ambiguous) x two reviews (negative review and no review) between-subject design. Findings - First, consumers are significantly less influenced by reviews for hedonic products compared to utilitarian products. In particular, they rely on reviews when evaluating utilitarian ambiguous properties (e.g. anti-aging properties) which they find difficult to judge on their own. Second, consumers are more resistant to the persuasive effect of reviews when the product focus is on sustainable (organic or fair-trade) credentials, in particular when judging ambiguous properties. Originality/value - This paper explores a topic neglected in the literature so far: the moderating role of product properties and sustainability, in particular, on consumers’ responses to persuasion and consumer reviews in the context of this paper. Its originality lies in the demonstration that consumers learn through product testing for hedonic and utilitarian unambiguous product properties and through consumer reviews for utilitarian ambiguous product properties. Additionally, it highlights the resistance of sustainable products (organic and fair-trade in this research) to negative product reviews. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "This paper investigates whether generation matters in the intention to buy green and sustainable products and, simultaneously, examines the antecedents of green and sustainable buying behaviour among three different generational cohorts (X, Y, and Z). By doing this, the present paper fills the gap regarding studies addressing the relationships between age and sustainable behaviour which have not included actual green and sustainable buying intention, along with the gap regarding studies only focussing on one or two (X and Y) generational cohorts. Drawing on the generational cohort theory, and by using a survey approach involving three samples of specific generations (X, Y, and Z), as well as by testing several hypotheses through ordinary least squares regression models, the paper finds that: (a) age plays a key role in the choice of green and socially friendly products, and (b) environmental concern and perceived consumer effectiveness are strong antecedents of green and sustainable purchase behaviour for all generational cohorts. This is also true for environmental citizenship, but this only applies to generations Y and Z. Finally, collectivism is only an antecedent of sustainable purchase behaviour for generation Z. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Food waste is a major threat to global sustainability. Much of it is caused by the aesthetic requirements imposed by retailers, which assume that consumers are not interested in buying misshapen produce unless it is accompanied by significant price discounts. This article proposes an alternative way to market such produce. A pilot study confirms consumers’ aversion to misshapen produce and identifies inferior taste perceptions as its dominant driver. Three studies then show that using anthropomorphism (i.e., attributing human characteristics to nonhuman objects) can increase purchase intentions for misshapen produce. Specifically, displaying misshapen produce with a smiling face and presenting shape abnormalities as body parts in point-of-purchase stimuli trigger positive affective reactions. These affective reactions enhance taste perceptions, thereby leading to higher purchase intentions and food choice. In addition, this research tests environmental concern as a moderator and measures actual behaviors in a grocery shopping context. The findings suggest an intervention that could be more effective than current public campaigns in the effort to curb waste along the entire food chain. © American Marketing Association 2019.",

    "Abstract": "Consumers have demonstrated new ways of engaging with fashion retailers and experiencing their brand values. This research aims to understand better how fashion consumers form their purchase intentions, by exploring how their expectations about corporate social responsibility influence consumer brand engagement and purchase intention. The research comprises two studies, using different methodologies. The first study is quantitative; it involved 1296 individuals and the results were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The second study is qualitative and utilizes expert opinions from the fashion industry; it seeks to derive managerial and practical implications from the findings of the first study. The results show that corporate social responsibility influences the purchase intention of fashion consumers, but mainly through brand engagement. Consequently, fashion companies should focus on building consumer trust in the sustainability initiatives of brands, including by utilizing local suppliers. © 2023 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "The reputation of firms for being environmentally friendly and socially responsible is a key purchase driver for sustainable products. However, the commitment of firms to sustainability varies – some firms are founded on strong environmental and social principles; other more traditional firms are built on strong product/brand focus and are not known for sustainability. In response to market trends, many traditional firms are introducing sustainable products to their portfolios. We argue that the firm's sustainability reputation (FSR) will influence consumer purchase with respect to equally sustainable products from different firms. Two choice studies demonstrate that FSR favors sustainable product choice when the consumer decides between equally sustainable products. However, FSR affects the choice only for sustainable products and not regular products and does so only for consumers that construe sustainability at a high (abstract) level. Retailers should pay attention to the role that FSR plays in consumer response when they select sustainable products to sell. © 2021 New York University",

    "Abstract": "The global pandemic and the economic consequences that follow have impelled B2B firms to revisit their positioning strategy so as to emphasize sustainability. However, it is still unclear whether B2B firms would benefit from positioning themselves as sustainable organizations. Drawing upon social exchange theory, this study examines the role of commitment as the underlying mechanism whereby B2B sustainable brand positioning influences relationship outcomes. A study involving senior managers of Australian B2B firms revealed the critical role of calculative and affective commitment in mediating the relationship between B2B sustainable brand positioning on willingness-to-pay premium price (WTP) and switching intention. However, buyer-supplier value congruence influences the effects of sustainable brand positioning on calculative and affective commitment in the opposite direction. Specifically, value congruence positively moderates the effects of sustainable brand positioning on calculative commitment, but negatively moderates the effects of sustainable brand positioning on affective commitment. The findings provide empirical evidence supporting the benefits that B2B firms can obtain by adopting sustainable brand positioning. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Year": "2023",
    "Abstract": "In the context of romantic relationships, partners regularly observe each other's unsustainable behavior. But how do these unsustainable behaviors influence each member of the couple? This research shows that how consumers respond to their partners’ unsustainable behaviors depends on the amount of relationship power they possess: high-relationship-power individuals compensate for their partners’ unsustainable behavior by acting in a more sustainable manner relative to their baseline tendencies, but low-relationship-power individuals do not increase their own sustainable behavior. This effect occurs because high-relationship-power partners feel more responsible for the reconstruction of the couple identity after it has been damaged by their partner's unsustainable choice; as a result, they have a stronger desire to signal a positive couple identity (i.e., a positive couple sustainable identity). Consistent with this theory, this effect is attenuated for high-relationship-power individuals who have weak green identities. Seven studies provide evidence for these findings by measuring and manipulating relationship power and assessing hypothetical and actual sustainable behaviors. This research contributes to the sustainable behavior literature and highlights effective ways to promote sustainable behavior in households. © The Author(s) 2022.",

    "Abstract": "Research has explored consumer responsibilization processes, yet there is a lack of understanding about the tensions that consumers might experience when enacting their responsibility. Using a large data set collected in France around waste responsibilization, we demonstrate how waste pathways can generate spatiotemporal, guidance, and destructiveness tensions in households. Consumers respond to such tensions by keeping waste at home, which allows them to suspend, clarify, or reappropriate their waste responsibility. In delineating the waste responsibility tensions, our study reveals the boundaries of neoliberal governance’s success in mobilizing entrepreneurial consumers’ actions, namely, community structure/shared vision, emotions, and market demand. These boundaries illustrate the challenges for neoliberal governance in providing and maintaining for consumers an illusion of control through the crafting of heightened uncertainty, abstraction, and risk–benefit categorizations. This study has implications for waste management actors, as well as consumer researchers interested in neoliberal governance, consumer responsibilization, consumer activism, sustainability, and waste disposal. © The Author(s) 2022.

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Although research demonstrates the importance of ethical product attributes for consumers, a prior study has not examined the role of consumption target (i.e. self-purchases vs gift-giving) on consumers’ preference for products with ethical attributes. Notably, consumers’ preference for quality can differ between self-purchases and gifts, and the presence of ethical attributes can impact product quality perceptions. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the presence of ethical attributes alters decision-making in a gift-giving context using perceptions of product quality as an explanatory variable for these differences. Design/methodology/approach: One field study and two controlled experiments test the proposed hypotheses. The experiments were conducted across different product categories and samples. Findings: Results showed that the presence of an ethical attribute leads to higher purchase intentions for products in a gift-giving context compared to self-purchase. Perceived quality mediates this effect. Further process evidence through moderation, including resource synergy beliefs, support the findings. This paper discusses the theoretical, managerial and societal implications of these results. Research limitations/implications: Although care was taken to select products to enhance generalizability, the studies presented here are limited to two products. Further, although the present research includes a field study with actual charity-related purchases, the role of time pressures is not explicitly explored. Finally, the role of brand-self connections is not explored in the current research. The ability for a donor to integrate the mission of a charity into their self-perception or the potential for social normative influences to impact behaviors remains open for exploration. Practical implications: Charities are facing increasing pressures to raise sustainable funds to support their missions. The research provides guidance to marketers and fundraisers in the non-profit sector that allows them to direct more focused fundraising appeals to donors and adapt their fundraising efforts to create a fit between their audience and fundraising appeals. Originality/value: This research demonstrates that consumption target (purchasing for the self versus purchasing for others) is a vital contextual factor that influences customer preference for ethical attributes. These results complement the extant literature by exploring the underlying mechanism behind consumers’ responses to the ethical attributes in the case of self-purchase and other-purchase. The underlying effect is supported theoretically by resource synergy beliefs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Governments enact various regulations to decrease the use of plastic. This raises the question of whether the effectiveness of such measures is restricted to the realm of the plastic products being regulated, or whether and how it ‘spills over’ on to the use of other plastic products. Leveraging scanner and survey data across 22 countries, the authors show that a ban or a charge on plastic bags strengthens descriptive social norms to avoid plastic, which in turn curbs the purchasing and use of plastic bottles, as well as of other plastics. Yet there is also a dark side to charging consumers for plastic bags, as a negative cueing effect can lower concerns about plastic pollution and make consumers less vigilant about their use of other plastic products. Taken together, this research shows that government regulation aimed at changing small common behaviors potentially has a much larger impact via spillover effects. © The Author(s) 2024.",

    "Year": "2011",
    "Abstract": "Faced with growing environmental problems, food safety issues, and increasing obesity rates, many consumers desire healthier, less processed natural foods that are less harmful to the environment. Yet organic foods only partially benefit from this market environment, and their market share remains quite low despite high growth rates. The usual explanation for this discrepancy is that consumers are not willing to pay the price premium prompted by an organic claim. In this paper, we explore the reasons behind consumers' (un)willingness to pay for organic food and investigate whether it differs between virtue and vice food categories. The results indicate that in vice food categories, organic claims are associated with lower quality, which seems to be only partly compensated by higher prosocial benefits. The lower-quality perceptions translate into a decreased consumer willingness to pay (WTP). We supplement the empirical results with data on organic purchases in the Dutch food market. These data show that market shares of organic food are indeed lower for vice categories of organic food. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "This study examines the proenvironmental persuasion of the so-called normative framing that incorporates normative influence (i.e., social norms) into message framing (i.e., loss vs. gain). Across three green contexts (i.e., towel reuse, paperless adoption, and ugly food consumption), this study shows that normative gain is consistently more effective than both normative loss and pure normative influence in promoting proenvironmental act, which is particularly motivated by positively framed information under the prospect-theoretic reasoning. This superior effect of normative gain is explained by the psychological sequence from collective efficacy to self-efficacy as the serial underlying mechanism. This study further unveils the boundary condition of anthropomorphism in amplifying this superiority (i.e., Mr. Nature, happy earth face) and reveals that the advantageous effect of normative gain is stronger among those low in interdependent self-construal.

    "Abstract": "Public policy makers seek to enhance disclosure of firms' sustainability performance, yet firms debate about whether, or to what extent, they should engage in sustainability reporting. This article seeks to advance current understanding about the business returns to sustainability reporting by examining the short- and long-term investor reactions. Through an event study, this research documents significant short-term stock market reaction to the release of sustainability reports. In particular, abnormal stock returns around the release of such reports are positively related to firm sustainability performance, and this positive link is smaller for firms in a strong information environment. The results show that over the long term, relative to nonreporting firms, firms that release sustainability reports enjoy higher value relevance of sustainability performance. These findings suggest that sustainability reports enhance information transparency and allow investors to incorporate sustainability information in stock valuation. This study provides strong evidence for the business case of sustainability reporting, and offers important implications for public policy makers in terms of devising policies and regulations to promote sustainability reporting. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Faced with the threat of climate change, there is a challenge to promote more environmentally friendly consumption patterns. This work seeks to unearth psychographic and socio-demographic factors that could trigger environmentally motivated reductions in consumption. The context of empirical investigation is the European Union (i.e., a large-scale sample of European citizens), with a focus on two key types of environmentally motivated consumption reduction: domestic and \"out-of-home\" (purchasing) activities. The findings show the interrelated effects of environmental knowledge and ecological motivations (in both aggregated and disaggregated forms) on positive and negative environmental attitudes, which in turn influence consumption reduction. There is also evidence of significant moderating influences of perceived environmental threat, gender, age, education, and country value orientation-particularly on \"environmental knowledge\" links.

    "Abstract": "Materialism is often blamed for consumers’ unsustainable consumption behaviors and its contribution to a growing “throwaway culture.” Conversely, frugal consumers are regarded as both restrained in their acquisition, and resourceful in their use and disposal of products. In this paper, the authors challenge and empirically test these prevailing beliefs. The authors focus on a much-neglected aspect of the consumption continuum: the disposal of products at the end-use of consumption, and how key consumer traits (i.e., materialism and frugality) influence behaviors at this stage. Specifically, the authors examined three creative end-use consumption behaviors with a sample of 398 US consumers. Results support the counter-intuitive notion that materialism, alongside frugality, has a positive impact on consumers’ sustainable consumption behaviors. The data suggest that materialistic consumers are prone to finding new and different uses for products and alternative methods of product disposal. The study’s results also support the notion that frugality interacts with materialism to increase intentions to find alternative methods of product disposal. The authors discuss the implications pertaining to their findings and pave the way for future research in sustainable consumption. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the effect of value-expressive and social-adjustive luxury attitudes on sustainable behaviors, specifically ecologically conscious consumer behavior, and socially responsible consumer behavior. This study investigates the mediating effect of the desire for unique products on the relationship between value-expressive and social-adjustive attitudes and sustainable behaviors. The moderating roles of brand self-congruence and the cultural values of collectivism and masculinity on these relationships are also explored. The results offer support for the mediating role of the desire for unique products. Furthermore, the connection between the desire for unique products and ecologically conscious consumer behavior (but not socially responsible consumer behavior) is enhanced with the moderating cultural value of collectivism and the connection between the desire for unique products and socially responsible consumer behavior (but not ecologically conscious consumer behavior) is enhanced by the moderating factor of brand self-congruence. The findings help to explain the conflicting findings regarding luxury and sustainability. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",

    "Source title": "Psychology and Marketing",
    "Method": "Survey",

    "Year": "2020",
    "Abstract": "Sharing economy (SE) platforms are increasingly providing an effective means of connecting providers and users of secondhand goods. While media seem to emphasize that the trend of selling/buying secondhand has been growing due to the consolidation and development of peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing platforms, a comprehensive identification of the antecedents of buying secondhand on SE platforms is virtually missing. This study addresses this gap by (a) identifying different sets of motivations and attitudes leading consumers to adopt SE platforms for secondhand buying and (b) testing a model on a sample of UK consumers in the context of P2P sharing platforms for secondhand clothing. This study reveals that there are three major antecedents of consumers' attitude towards buying secondhand clothes on P2P–SE platforms: perceived sustainability, economic motivations, and taking a distance from the consumption system. Perceived sustainability and economic motivations influence positively attitude toward buying secondhand, as well as motivations in the form of distance from the consumption system. Attitude toward buying secondhand is positively influenced also by distance from the system and, in turn, has a strong positive influence on behavioral intention to buy secondhand clothes. Moreover, past experience of buying secondhand online has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between perceived sustainability and distance from the consumption system. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Environmental sustainability is often depicted as an important attribute of consideration among consumers. Even if multiple barriers may prevent them from “walking the talk,” a common implicit assumption is that consumers think about sustainability but choose a less eco-friendly route once confronted with such obstacles (e.g., higher prices). Absent from the literature, however, is a systematic investigation of the extent to which sustainability thoughts even come to consumers’ minds. Across six studies using a diverse set of measurements (free and aided elicitation), time of purchase (past or contemporaneous), consumer contexts (online or brick-and-mortar settings), levels of consequentialism (hypothetical or incentive-compatible), and samples (Brazil, UK, and US; N=7,942), our research consistently demonstrates that most consumers neglect the products’ environmental impact when making purchase decisions of fast-moving consumer goods. Environmental sustainability considerations are low in absolute terms, relative to other attributes, and even compared to participants’ own injunctive norms. Cognitive accessibility and contextual salience help explain the phenomenon. Considerations increase among consumers with strong environmental goals (e.g., high on biospheric values), for products highly prototypical of the sustainability cause (e.g., plastic bags), and when consumers are prompted with sustainability cues prior to choice (e.g., eco-labels). Methodological, managerial, and policy implications are discussed, and a simple framework to promote environmental sustainability consideration is proposed. © 2024 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "In the face of the growing prevalence of multiple appeals to sustainable consumption in marketers’ sustainable product communications, we examine the efficacy, in terms of consumer reactions, of adding an extrinsic appeal (e.g., “Purchase this green product to save money!”) to an intrinsic appeal (e.g., “Purchase this green product to save the environment!”) based communication for a sustainable product. Three studies provide support for our basic assertion that, compared to an intrinsic appeal, joint appeals (i.e., an intrinsic and extrinsic appeal together) reduce consumer preference for sustainable products. As well, these studies demonstrate that this adverse effect of joint appeals is based on a lowering of consumers’ attributions of the company's sustainability efforts to intrinsic motives (e.g., to the company's genuine concern for the environment). Finally, not all consumers react adversely to joint appeals; relative to intrinsic appeals, such appeals increase, rather than decrease, the intrinsic attributions and sustainable product preferences for consumers with lower involvement with sustainable consumption. © 2018 Society for Consumer Psychology",

    "Abstract": "Food overconsumption contributes greatly to health problems that affect a large portion of the population while also straining the earth's natural resources. Attempts by policy makers to encourage sustainable food practices often focus more on the role of producers and less on the role of consumers, even though a growing number of consumers are concerned about the sustainability of their food products. Yet consumers often fail to perceive any immediate, personal benefits from consuming sustainably; instead, they envision future societal-level benefits. Three studies capturing actual behavior-the consumption of food and beverages-provide evidence that food promoted as sustainable can produce individual consumer benefits through reduced consumption. Study 1 shows the effect ofsustainability in lessening consumption. Study 2 demonstrates how sustainability semantically primes a prosocial focus, which is the mechanism involved in the reduction of consumption. Study 3 then shows that this effect is enhanced for people with higher levels of self-control. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected in two studies. Study 1 collected data from 219 consumers in a large shopping mall. Study 2 followed an experimental approach and used data from 327 participants. Findings: The current research contributes to theory by hypothesizing and demonstrating when transparency is associated with higher willingness for sustainable and responsible consumption. Critically, the positive benefits of transparency vary according to a business’ future orientation, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and levels of customer involvement. Practical implications: An important societal and practical implication of the current research is that business should not be expected to only focus on transparency in isolation but rather also needs to consider levels of perceived future orientation, CSR and levels of customer involvement to strengthen sustainable and responsible behavior effectively. Originality/value: This research builds on and extends current knowledge by exploring the key role of business’ transparency in influencing sustainable and responsible customer behavior and examines critical boundary conditions for the observed effects. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Year": "2020",
    "Abstract": "This paper explores the potential negative side-effects of the sustainability movement in societies with large segments of materialistic consumers. Across three studies, there is evidence that a conflict between materialistic and green value profiles can arise in consumers. When it arises, it seems to be related to diminished well-being. Study 1 shows that consumers with a higher value conflict (VC) experienced higher levels of stress. Consumers with higher degrees of stress then reported lower satisfaction with life. Study 2 reveals the underlying process by which this value conflict affects well-being. The results suggest that the value conflict is related to a reduced clarity of consumers’ self-concept (SCC), which in turn is related to increased levels of stress and a lower satisfaction with life. Results of Study 3 show that preference for consistency (PfC) serves as a boundary condition to this effect. The negative effect of VC on SCC is most pronounced among consumers high in PfC, while low PfC consumers seem to suffer less from the negative consequences of a conflict between green and materialistic values. Conceptual and public-policy implications of these results are discussed. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In limited-information environments like restaurants, consumers are forced to make health inferences by drawing from the menu or promotional materials or by using their intuition. Understanding such health inferences related to plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs), which are available at a rapidly growing number of restaurants, is increasingly important. In addition to their clear environmental benefits, PBMAs are widely promoted as being healthier than traditional meat. Across five experiments, results illustrate that although some perceptions of PBMAs are aligned with reality (e.g., environmental friendliness), consumers greatly underestimate calories and nutrition (e.g., fat, sodium) relative to objective values. Additionally, consumers believe PBMAs are substantially healthier than, and decrease disease risk relative to, traditional meat, which is not always true. The currently accepted interventions of calorie labeling and nutrition information disclosure are not enough to attenuate this “health halo.” However, ensuring that consumers actively compare menu items realigns perceptions with reality. The health halo resulting from inferences formed with the limited information available at the point of purchase has numerous implications for public health, sustainable consumerism, and public policy decisions. © American Marketing Association 2023.",

    "Abstract": "Advertising bans typically target products that deceive consumers in ways that can threaten their physical and mental health. An alternative policy objective might seek environmental protection through a ban on print advertising. Such measures would profoundly affect grocery retailers relying on printed leaflets to communicate weekly promotions. We measure the causal effect of banning advertising on retail performance by studying a temporary advertising ban implemented in a German federal state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ban resulted in the suspension of all print advertising by grocery retailers, and the exogenous variation in advertising created by this natural experiment serves as our identification strategy. We apply difference-in-differences regressions to data from a national grocery retailer and find that the ban resulted in a 6% sales decrease in the treated state compared with an adjacent state. GfK Household Panel data reveal no effect of the advertising ban on the market level but a negative impact on retailers offering and advertising weekly promotional product assortments. We study the sensitivity of these results to the COVID pandemic and find that neither changes in COVID-19 incidence, vaccination rates, nor customers’ mobility moderate the ad ban effect. The findings offer practical insights for regulators and retailers regarding the impact of ad bans and the value of advertising. © 2024 The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "To reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, public policy makers often try to stimulate the use of public transport, as it is a more sustainable alternative to traveling by car. This study therefore investigates the impact of firm-initiated marketing actions and traveler satisfaction on monthly cumulative traveled distance of a Western European railway firm, as well as possible effects of this cumulative traveled distance on satisfaction. Analysis of time-series data on traveled distance, advertising, promotions, and satisfaction using a vector autoregressive model with exogenous variables that accounts for seasonality, trending behavior, and gasoline prices reveals positive effects of advertising and promotions. Advertising elasticities are considerably smaller than meta-analytic values of brand-advertising elasticities. Similarly, promotion elasticities are lower than those frequently reported in marketing. The authors find no effect of satisfaction on traveled distance; however, they do find a negative effect of traveled distance on satisfaction, which could be explained by capacity constraints. The authors conclude that firm-initiated marketing actions are useful and effective in fostering public transport usage. © American Marketing Association 2019.",

    "Abstract": "In developed countries, sustainability is increasingly an active agenda topic for businesses. Yet a view on what sustainability exactly means in the minds of consumers is missing. In response to this research opportunity, online panel respondents from seven advanced economies (France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, N = 5620) were surveyed in two cross-sectional waves. Factor analytical results show that consumers associate sustainability with three key subdimensions: ‘social equality’ (e.g., fair wages), ‘circularity’ (e.g., recycling) and ‘naturalness’ (e.g., avoiding use of pesticides and GMOs). This observation offers inspiration to update the traditional two-dimensional (social vs. environmental) structure of sustainability advanced in previous literature. In addition, the identified ‘naturalness’ dimension may point to a new route to stimulate pro-environmental behavior as it has both a strong link with the environment and may introduce an affective undertone. We discuss theoretical and managerial implications, and report observed country, gender, and age differences. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

    "Abstract": "When a policy gives temporary incentives for healthy behaviors, how long does the impact last? The U.S. Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children gives food vouchers to young children and their mothers. Using household-level scanner data, I study the reform of the program that introduced vouchers for healthier products. The difference-in-differences analysis shows that the reform makes purchases healthier during the program participation in the product categories most targeted by the reform (bread and milk). However, the effect is not always persistent. For bread, the effect decreases significantly within a couple of years after participants exit the program. Demand model estimates imply that price differences between healthy and unhealthy products play a large role in decreasing the program’s impact. Therefore, some differences in the persistence can be explained by the relatively higher prices of healthy foods. Coun-terfactual analysis shows that a modest postprogram subsidy might be a sustainable way to lengthen the program’s impact and lead to long-term healthier purchases. © 2022 INFORMS.",

    "Year": "2022",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to investigate the effect of healthy food advertising (HFA) in preventing obesity (measured using the healthy eating attitude and perceived self-regulatory success) through the meta-cognitive role of consumer wisdom (CW). The meta-cognitive role of CW to better promote healthy eating attitude and behavior is relevant and underexplored. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 310 young consumers through an online survey. Reliability and validity were established using confirmatory factor analysis, and hypotheses were analyzed through structural equation modeling using MPlus V8.3. Findings: The results reveal that HFA has a positive influence on all dimensions of CW: responsibility, purpose, perspective, reasoning and sustainability. All dimensions but one augment a positive healthy eating attitude, but only responsibility and sustainability enhance consumers’ self-regulatory success. The findings show that HFA does not directly prevent obesity, but CW mediates the relationship between that advertising and obesity prevention. These findings show that CW establishes a mindful connection between HFA and obesity control. Research limitations/implications: This research extends the theory of CW in the context of healthful eating and contributes significantly to the advertising, hospitality and obesity literature. Practical implications: This study also has implications for multiple stakeholders, including consumers, restaurant operators, hospitality managers, brand managers, the government and society in general. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study marks the first attempt to investigate the role of CW in preventing obesity. It is also the first study to examine the relationships of HFA with CW and a healthful attitude toward eating. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Retailers increasingly recognize that environmental responsibility is a strategic imperative. However, little research has investigated or identified the factors that facilitate the successful implementation of environmentally responsible strategies across a network of customer-facing sales units (stores). We propose that a store manager’s ability to lead by example facilitates this process by fostering a supportive climate for store environmental stewardship (SENS-climate). By examining the influence of store managers’ actions on sales associates’ perceptions of the SENS-climate, as well as the subsequent impact on their performance—measured by margins, as well as sales of green and regular products—this study demonstrates that store managers can foster a SENS-climate by articulating their prioritization of environmental responsibility in their operational decisions. These positive effects are sustained by relational factors, such as the moderating effect of the store manager–sales associate dyadic tenure. In contrast, when store managers display high variability in their environmental orientation, it hinders the development of SENS-climate perceptions among sales associates. If sales associates perceive an enabling SENS-climate, they achieve higher margins and more green but fewer regular sales. © 2015, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This research introduces the prosocial ambassador effect as a novel means to elicit prosocial behavior. Consumers adopt a prosocial ambassador role when they personally commit to engage in a prosocial behavior and interpersonally promote (i.e., encourage another person to engage in) the prosocial behavior. Four experiments, including two studies in the field, investigate prosocial ambassadorship behaviors and their impact on the ambassadors’ subsequent prosocial behavior. Results reveal that the ambassador role activates a collective identity, which drives prosocial behavior. Findings also indicate that the ambassador effect endures over time. Furthermore, the ambassador effect replicates via product giveaways and communications (e.g., text messages). This research offers novel implications for marketers on the ambassador role's positive impact on prosociality, providing guidance to firms on how to leverage the ambassador effect in the marketplace. © American Marketing Association 2024.",

    "Abstract": "Academic research into social entrepreneurship orientation (SEO) remains nascent, despite social entrepreneurship receiving increasing attention in both research and practice. This study of 308 industrial industry firms from Austria and Northern Macedonia contributes to closing these research gaps by investigating how SEO influences social entrepreneurial performance taking into account the performance consequences of heterogeneity in firms' characteristics demonstrated by start-ups and established firms using multi-group structural equation modeling and fsQCA as methods of comparison. Combining person-centered and variable-centered methods, this study contributes by exploring how SEO influences social entrepreneurial performance and considering firms' characteristics for both start-ups and established industrial firms. The study highlights key differences for start-ups and established firms. The development phase of a firm, thus, plays a key role when examining SEO dimensions. This study informs practices of individuals seeking to undertake a business start-up or owner/managers involved in the operation and management of established firms in a social entrepreneurship context. The findings will be of interest to the enterprise support community in tailoring funding and training support for social enterprises for both start-ups and established firms. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "In response to growing environmental concerns, governments have promoted products that are less harmful to the environment—green products—through various incentives. We empirically study the impact of a commonly used nonmonetary incentive— namely, the single-occupancy permission to high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes—on green and non-green product demand in the U.S. automobile industry. The HOV incentive could increase unit sales of green vehicles by enhancing their functional value through time saving. On the other hand, the incentive may prove counterproductive if it reduces the symbolic value (i.e., signaling a proenvironmental image) consumers derive from green vehicles. Assessing the effectiveness of green-product incentives is challenging, given the endogenous nature of governments’ incentive provisions. To identify the effect of the HOV incentive on unit sales of green and non-green vehicles, we take advantage of HOV-incentive changes in two states, and we employ a multitude of quasi-experimental methods using a data set at the county–model–month level. Unlike previous studies that only examine the launch of the HOV incentive and find an insignificant association be-tween incentive launch and green-vehicle demand, we concentrate on its termination. We find that the termination of the HOV incentive decreases unit sales of vehicles covered by the incentive by 14.4%. We provide suggestive evidence that this significant negative effect of HOV-incentive termination is due to the elimination of the functional value the incentive provides: time saving. Specifically, we find that the negative effect is more pronounced in counties where consumers value time saving more (i.e., counties with a longer commute to work and higher income). Additionally, in line with prior literature, the launch of the HOV incentive is not found to have a significant effect on green-vehicle sales. Combined, our findings reveal that the effect of termination is not simply the opposite of that of launch, implying that governments’ green-product incentives could backfire. © 2020 INFORMS.",

    "Abstract": "Extant research on collaborative consumption in the sharing economy generally focuses on consumers (those who consume such services) while overlooking an important actor: the peer service providers (those who provide these services by sharing their resources with other consumers). Through four studies, we show a potential detrimental side effect of collaborative consumption. Specifically, our results suggest that for peer service providers, sharing their assets leads to a greater perceived loss of psychological ownership of these assets. This phenomenon thus results in a potentially unsustainable outcome: faster disposal of the shared assets. The authors further show that this effect disappears when the asset is shared with in-group (vs. out-group) members. Lastly, the authors offer a practical and easily implementable solution that could avert this potentially detrimental phenomenon: To encourage service providers to personalize their assets, which restores their perceived psychological ownership. Together, these results advance the literature on the dark side of collaborative consumption and offer managerial insights into mitigating strategies. © 2024 The Author(s)",

    "Abstract": "The promotion of reuse and resale has been receiving extensive attention worldwide for the sake of sustainability. The current research provides insights into this area and identifies a “reuse and resale cycle,” whereby consumers are more willing to resell products they originally obtained second hand, compared to products they obtained brand new. One potential mechanism that accounts for this effect is the relatively weak connection consumers form with the second-hand items they own. Six studies confirmed this effect across various product categories. Study 1 tracked consumers’ actual resale of the possessions they owned in real life. Subsequent studies provided further empirical evidence for the proposed effect, uncovered the underlying mechanism concerning the strength of the connection with the product, and showed that the effect diminished among consumers who chronically have a high tendency to link themselves with their possessions. This research advances the understanding of resale behaviors. It has implications for consumers to avoid retaining excessive possessions and for the second-hand market to develop in a healthy manner, eventually contributing to society’s sustainability in the long run. © The Author(s) 2024.",

    "Abstract": "Research on open innovation and sustainability suggests that alliances with external stakeholders help to improve innovation outcomes. This paper taps into the intersection of these literatures and investigates how alliance proactiveness and alliance portfolio coordination affect firms' sustainability-oriented innovation (SOI) outcomes. Data were collected from 170 firms in the Basque Country region in Spain, which has a highly collaborative regional innovation system. Partial least squares (PLS) modeling confirmed that alliance proactiveness is positively related to radical SOI, while alliance portfolio coordination is positively related to incremental SOI. In addition, these two capabilities involve a positive interaction effect in the case of radical SOI. An additional set of post hoc tests using latent class analysis (FIMIX-PLS) provided further evidence that firms with different internal features and levels of environmental turbulence benefit to varying extents from these capabilities and their interactions. Overall, the findings of this study show the benefits of the coupled mode of open innovation and alliance capabilities in reaching positive outcomes in SOI. On the one hand, companies focusing on incremental SOI can reap greater benefits from open innovation when collaborating within their existing portfolio; while for radical SOI, alliance proactiveness is beneficial for finding disruptive partners. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, global urbanization and overdevelopment have resulted in environmental degradation and an energy crisis. Promoting green buildings is among the most effective methods for achieving environmental sustainability. Although the initial costs of green buildings are higher than those of ordinary buildings, people perceive that the environmental benefits of green buildings justify their higher price premiums. From a developer's perspective, devising optimal pricing strategies according to customer-perceived prices and developers’ expected profit is complex and difficult. Hence, in this study, we developed a framework based on the Howard–Sheth model of consumer behavior to identify behavioral factors that may affect consumer purchases of green buildings. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then used to develop a pricing model for predicting the price premiums of green buildings. The results revealed that the ANN model's overall prediction capability was 94%; the model's robustness was demonstrated by comparing the results produced using the model with those produced using a multiple regression analysis. In addition, the characteristics of consumers who were willing to accept higher price premiums for green buildings were identified and discussed. The proposed model can be applied as an effective decision-support tool for green building pricing and formulating marketing strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",

Across three studies, this research investigates the role of three representations of God: (1) God as an authoritarian personified being, (2) God as a benevolent personified being, and (3) God as a mystical cosmic force. The results of Study 1 suggest that attitude toward nature mediates the relationship between these representations of God and three sustainability behaviors. Similarly, the results of Study 2 suggest that attitude tdward nature mediates the relationship between these representations of God and the importance of proenvironmental policies. In addition, the authors find self-transcendence to be an antecedent of belief in a mystical representation of God. Study 3 includes awe as an antecedent of self-transcendence and generally replicates the findings from Study 2 regarding the role of the representations of God in people's cognitive processing of their willingness to vote for proenvironmental policies. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",

In study 1, persuasive appeals consistent with individualizing and binding moral foundations were developed to enhance liberal and conservative recycling. In study 2, individualizing and binding appeals were tested on actual recycling behavior using a longitudinal field study to demonstrate the effectiveness of messages congruent with the moral foundations of liberals and conservatives. Study 3 demonstrated that enhanced fluency represents the underlying psychological process that mediates the relationship between message congruence and intentions. Moreover, study 3 established that spillover effects resulting from increased intentions to engage in sustainable disposition behavior enhance intentions to engage in sustainable acquisition and consumption behaviors.

    "Abstract": "Sustainable innovations in food packaging are important in terms of preventing food waste and reducing environmental impact, but existing industry regimes and networks may hinder their diffusion into established markets. However, research on reorientation of existing industries, and value networks in that situation, has been limited. This study examines the changes to existing industry value networks that can facilitate the diffusion of sustainable innovation in food packaging. Empirically, the transformation and distribution of agro-food waste into a new bioplastic packaging through the existing food packaging value network is investigated. As a result, the changes to the existing value network and their connections, facilitating the diffusion of the sustainable innovation, are identified at three levels – firm, network, and macro. The findings show the importance of opportunity recognition, but also the role of new actors, resources, activities, and relationships in the restructuring of the existing value network and actions creating supportive regulative framework and increasing market demand for such renewal. This creates understanding of how the adoption of sustainable innovations, such as new packaging materials, which might seem simple, is complicated by the broad changes required from the existing value network. © 2020 The Authors",

    "Abstract": "Prior research has demonstrated the critical role of values in promoting sustainable consumption behaviors. However, research is needed to identify novel ways to influence these values so that consumers will act on them. The present research demonstrates a practical and underappreciated way to enhance the values that promote sustainable consumption behaviors. Specifically, we demonstrate that mindfulness has a positive relationship with biospheric and altruistic values (but not egoistic values), and that these values mediate the relationship between mindfulness and two distinct forms of sustainable consumption: socially conscious consumption and frugal (i.e., reduced) consumption. We employ a series of three studies with sample populations drawn from different countries, and we use multiple measures for each of our focal constructs to demonstrate the robustness of our findings. Our findings suggest that marketers and policy makers can integrate mindfulness into their promotion and education initiatives as a means to help consumers clarify their values and, thereby, increase levels of sustainable consumption. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Achieving a sustainable economy is one of the primary needs of our time, and sustainable products can play a decisive role in achieving this goal. This article seeks answers about the role of time and product characteristics in the intention to switch to a sustainable product using the example of an everyday product. Drawing from social identity theory, utility maximization and switching theory, the authors propose a conceptual model to examine these questions in a specific market disruption when a product is modified by the same company. The framework focuses on the time-varying effects of customers' features (brand identification, loyalty, embeddedness) and products' features (perceived value [PV], compliance, switching cost) on switching behavior. The research was carried out using a quasi-experimental method in three periods. In the first stage, Cox Proportional Hazard Regression was used, and a random-effects model in the second. Results from longitudinal data of 282 customers during the launch of a new sustainable product show that customer characteristics do not influence the intention to switch. In contrast, the PV and switching costs inhibit the switching behavior, but their effects vary over time. In particular, the effect of the relative PV of the sustainable product on switching will increase over time, but the importance of customer–brand identification also rises. The study has important implications for introducing a sustainable equivalent of an incumbent product of the same brand. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Abstract": "Integrating sustainability aspects into product development has long been recognized as a strategic priority for practitioners. Yet the literature reports mixed results on the product development effectiveness outcomes of sustainable product development strategies, while scant research has investigated how companies integrate environmental aspects into product development. This study develops a model that integrates effectiveness-enhancing outcomes and organizational inputs of eco-friendly product development strategies. Using questionnaire responses from firms from multiple industries, supplemented with lagged primary product development performance data, we find that top management commitment and corporate environmental support policies can facilitate eco-friendly product development strategies, while environmental performance incentives do not. In turn, the adoption of such strategies has a positive effect on firms’ product development effectiveness. This effect weakens when business conditions are highly complex but tends to become stronger with increasing levels of munificence in the business environment. These findings have important implications for practitioners and researchers that are discussed. © 2016, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Unsustainable consumption is an important cause of the continued deterioration of the global environment. The authors compare the ecological impact of anticonsumption lifestyles and environmental concern. Findings indicate that high scores on anticonsumption lifestyles (voluntary simplicity, frugality, and tightwadism) and environmental concern are associated with lower ecological impact. More precisely, the findings show that these lifestyles are not associated with a reduction in consumption, as their stereotypes would imply. Voluntary simplicity (β = −.286) and tightwadism (β = −.216) show a stronger association with lower ecological impact (i.e., are less harmful to the environment) than environmental concern (β = −.190), whereas frugality (β = −.089) is not associated with reduced impact after demographic variables were controlled for. The findings pertaining to voluntary simplicity and tightwadism suggest that resisting consumption is an alternative path toward more sustainable consumption. Public policy makers and marketers can build on these findings and include reduced consumption and sufficiency in their sustainability strategies. © American Marketing Association 2018.",

    "Abstract": "With the burgeoning of consumer culture and materialism on a global scale, a counter-culture movement, namely, voluntary simplicity, is slowly gaining currency. Extant research reveals a degree of disparateness in the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity. Drawing on the value-basis theory and anti-consumption research, the current study attempts at an unorthodox study of the fledgling culture of anti-consumption in urban India. The paper empirically examines the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity in India. This research, through an experimental study followed by a sample survey, conducted among urban Indian consumers, examines how satisfaction with life, self-efficacy, and individualism interact with materialistic values to eventually influence voluntary simplicity attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 74 working professionals), we experimentally triggered materialistic aspirations and evaluated their effects on voluntary simplicity in comparison to a control condition. In Study 2 (N = 315), individuals self-rated their materialistic values, satisfaction with life, self-efficacy, cultural orientation, and voluntary simplicity attitude. Our study, contrary to the suggestions in the existing literature, demonstrates that materialists espouse voluntary simplicity attitudes when environmental degradation around them directly impacts their health, wealth, and well-being. In addition to the positive direct effect, satisfaction with life and self-efficacy serially mediate the relationship between materialism and voluntary simplicity, providing a welcome divergence from dark-sided conceptualizations of materialism. Our results help global marketers, and public policymakers better understand the interaction between materialistic values and sustainable consumption attitudes, in the developing country perspective. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Year": "2022",
    "Abstract": "As consumers become more aware of and concerned about the environmental impact of their consumption choices, an increasing number of luxury brands are now engaging in sustainability practices. This study examines factors influencing the effectiveness of embedding sustainability in luxury brands. Specifically, the research focus is the effect of childhood socioeconomic status on moderating consumer preferences for sustainable (vs. regular, nonsustainable) luxury brands. Four experimental studies using different product categories and luxury brands show that preferences for sustainable (vs. regular, nonsustainable) luxury brands are stronger among consumers with relatively low (vs. high) childhood socioeconomic status (Studies 1–4). Notably, these preference patterns are driven by differences in the perceived importance of cooperation in the community among consumers with low versus high childhood socioeconomic status (Study 3). However, these divergent patterns are attenuated when consumption involves the nonluxury brand category (Study 2), and when consumers experience a high-threat environment (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic; Study 4). As such, the findings of this study contribute to the literature by shedding light on the conditions under which consumers show preferences for sustainable (vs. regular, nonsustainable) luxury brands, establishing a theoretically grounded mediator (importance of cooperation in the community) and moderator (perceived environmental threat). © 2022 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "As digital technologies disrupt one sector after another, many companies are actively embracing digital transformation. However, the relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance remains unclear. To fill this gap, based on an integrated perspective of dynamic capability and organizational inertia, this study examines the curvilinear relationships between digital transformation and economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable performance. Survey data from 223 Chinese companies articulate that although digital transformation fosters economic performance at an accelerating rate, it depicts an inverse U-shaped relationship with environmental performance. More interestingly, the accelerating rate of digital transformation on economic performance is quicker under low market turbulence. In contrast, when market turbulence is high, higher digital transformation is associated with worse environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature by providing new theoretical explanations for the inconsistent relationship between digital transformation and sustainable performance. This study also assists companies in re-evaluating their digital strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Year": "2024",
    "Abstract": "It is widely believed that younger generations are at the forefront of sustainability efforts. Given the significance of fostering greater consumer participation in sustainable consumption, this perception prompts an intriguing question: If consumers associate sustainability with younger individuals, can simply instilling a sense of youthfulness increase their engagement in sustainable consumption, regardless of their actual age? Building upon previous research on subjective age—that is, how old one feels—and consumer identity, we propose that consumers will gravitate towards sustainable products when they feel younger than older. This is because such products align well with their perceived age identity, creating a perception of fit. The findings across three studies provide converging evidence that simply making consumers feel younger can result in an increased preference for sustainable products. Study 1 demonstrated that feeling younger increased the selection of more sustainable products over less sustainable ones. Study 2 showed that this effect is mediated by the perceived fit. Study 3 further supported the underlying mechanism by revealing that the focal effect was mitigated when the association between sustainability and younger age was weakened. Study 4 replicated the focal effect in a consequential choice setting. Finally, Study 5 confirmed the proposed effect by using trait subjective age as a predictor. © 2024 The Author(s).

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2024",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to examine the influence of social media usage (SMU) on minimalist consumption and how the fear of missing out (FoMO) underlies this effect. Design/methodology/approach: Four preregistered correlational/experimental studies (n = 1,763) are used. A pilot study (n = 436) examines the correlations between SMU, FoMO and minimalism. Studies 1 (n = 409), 2 (n = 415) and 3 (n = 503) further investigate the influence of SMU on minimalist consumption intentions, including mindful purchase, forgoing free products and decluttering, and test for evidence of mediation via FoMO by measuring or manipulating FoMO. Findings: The results show that a high SMU makes consumers susceptible to FoMO, leading to impulsive purchases and careless product acquisition. However, when campaigners promote minimalism as a social media movement, they can activate FoMO, persuading consumers to practice decluttering. Research limitations/implications: Future research might examine how subjective age affects FoMO and minimalist consumption tendencies. Could campaigners use young social cues to make older consumers more susceptible to FoMO appeals? Could old social cues cause younger consumers to perceive greater social responsibility and to embrace minimalist consumption? Practical implications: Minimalist lifestyles can promote sustainable consumption. This research provides insights into how SMU is a double-edged sword – it can cause FoMO users to disdain minimalism. However, it can promote minimalism if a minimalist campaign is strategically positioned as a social media movement using a FoMO-laden appeal. Originality/value: Extant consumer behavior research on minimalism has just begun to investigate the antecedents of minimalist consumption. FoMO is conceptually related to minimalism, but the relationship between FoMO and minimalist consumption has not yet been empirically tested. This research fills these gaps by examining SMU and the associated FoMO as antecedents of minimalist consumption. Empirical evidence for the impact of SMU on various minimalist consumption behaviors and the mediating role of FoMO is provided. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Year": "2020",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Ethical consumption is an integral component for the sustainable development in the world and is especially challenging in the Western consumer society. This research demonstrates that mindfulness, a Buddhism-based notion, is associated with two related and distinctive approaches of ethical consumption: refinement and reduction. It examines the psychological mechanisms underlying the effects of mindfulness on these two approaches of ethical consumption. Design/methodology/approach: Self-report data were collected through an online survey with consumers from western societies (N = 523). Findings: The findings show (1) that the significance of mindfulness on both approaches of ethical consumption and (2) that the contrast between the different mechanisms underlying them. Specifically, the mindfulness–consumption refinement link is fully mediated by connectedness-to-nature whereas the mindfulness–consumption reduction link is fully mediated by connectedness-to-nature and self-control. A series of supplementary studies further confirmed the proposed model. Research limitations/implications: It demonstrates the multifaceted and complex nature of ethical consumption, which is positively associated with mindfulness but through distinctive psychological mechanisms. Practical implications: The multifaceted and complex nature of ethical consumption and its underlying drivers need special attention. Mindfulness can be an effective means to boost ethical consumption behavior. Meanwhile, nurturing the sense of connectedness to nature and self-control capability facilitates the path-through of the positive impacts of mindfulness Social implications: The findings can be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of mindfulness practice in promoting ethical consumption towards achieving the Sustainable Consumption goal, especially in the West. Originality/value: The paper makes original contribution by conceptualizing two interrelated and distinctive approaches of ethical consumption and shows how mindfulness promotes both through different mediating pathways. Overall, this study paints a clearer picture how mindfulness relates to ethical consumption. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "Food producers and retailers throw away large amounts of perfectly edible produce that fails to meet appearance standards, contributing to the environmental issue of food waste. The authors examine why consumers discard aesthetically unattractive produce, and they test a low-cost, easy-to-implement solution: emphasizing the produce’s aesthetic flaw through “ugly” labeling (e.g., labeling cucumbers with cosmetic defects “Ugly Cucumbers” on store displays or advertising). Seven experiments, including two conducted in the field, demonstrate that “ugly” labeling corrects for consumers’ biased expectations regarding key attributes of unattractive produce—particularly tastiness—and thus increases purchase likelihood. “Ugly” labeling is most effective when associated with moderate (rather than steep) price discounts. Against managers’ intuition, it is also more effective than alternative labeling that does not exclusively point out the aesthetic flaw, such as “imperfect” labeling. This research provides clear managerial recommendations on the labeling and the pricing of unattractive produce while addressing the issue of food waste. © The Author(s) 2021.",

    "Year": "2022",
    "Abstract": "Today, consumers expect companies to be socially responsible. However, the literature is undecided about the effects of communicating one's corporate social responsibility activities to consumers. This raises the question of how sustainability-driven companies can best advertise their products to stimulate ethical consumption: using self-benefit frames, where the main beneficiary is the consumer, or using other-benefit frames, where the main beneficiary is a third party. Using three experiments, this study examines the effect of other-benefit (vs. self-benefit) advertising frames on consumers' impulse purchases from sustainability-driven companies. Increasing impulse purchases can help such companies to strengthen their competitive positions. Additionally, it is studied to what extent two types of justification (moral versus deservingness) explain the proposed effect of advertising frames. The results show that only other-benefit frames affect impulse buying behavior, both directly, as mediated by moral justification. This study's insights may help sustainability-driven companies to decide on their advertising strategies by providing evidence that other-benefit-framed advertisements are more effective in enhancing impulse purchases than self-benefit-framed advertisements. © 2022 The Authors.

These effects do not arise for literally dirty (vs. clean) advertisements, helping to support a goal activation account, rather than mere semantic priming. Further, the effect of figuratively dirty (vs. clean) advertisements on recycling-related behavior is amplified for consumers higher in internalized moral identity. These findings contribute to the literatures on consumer goal activation, moral identity, and sustainability, and have practical implications for marketers considering explicit advertising campaigns and public policy makers wanting to better understand the drivers of consumer recycling. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "A popular trend within the fashion industry is to transform recycled plastic bottles into attire, though little research has examined consumer acceptance of these items. This study integrates evolutionary perspectives on contagion, contamination, and the emotion of disgust to explore consumer perception of such goods. Across three studies, this study shows that consumers view products made from used recycled plastic bottles as contaminated, decreasing purchase intentions. Further, this contamination perception is heightened among those with high disgust sensitivity. This study also shows an important boundary condition to this effect, where consumers express greater intentions to use a product made from recycled plastic bottles when it is not touching the skin (e.g., carrying bag) compared to those that are in contact with skin (e.g., T-shirt). Finally, this study shows how marketers can harness this effect by exploiting the evolutionary response to attractive others using the plastic bottles, which results in positive contamination and an increase in willingness to pay. In so doing, the current research is the first to show that highlighting the recycled nature of a product can actually serve as a contamination cue, adding to our theoretical understanding of perceived contamination and the resulting emotion of disgust. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "To fight food waste, retail stores have begun selling perishable food close to the expiration date at discounted prices. To render this form of last-minute discounting effective, digital platforms have been developed with the major aim to connect local retail stores and their consumers by sharing information about these discounts. To sustain digital platforms, platform leaders need to ensure both consumers and retail stores remain active on it. To provide platform leaders with advice on how to create a sustainable digital platform, we examine how retail store activity on the digital platform affects consumer activity, and vice versa (also known as cross-side network effects). By combining a PVAR model and an impulse response function, along with data from a digital platform aimed at food waste reduction, we find that the effect of consumer activity on retail store activity is stronger and more long-lasting than the effect of retail store activity on consumer activity. We discuss the implications of our findings for both retail stores and digital platform leaders. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Consumers are increasingly mindful of corporate social responsibility (CSR) when making purchase and consumption decisions, but evidence of the impact of CSR initiatives on actual purchase decisions is lacking. This article introduces a novel brand accountability–based framework of consumer response to CSR initiatives, which categorizes CSR efforts as “corrective,” “compensating,” or “cultivating goodwill.” Leveraging a database of CSR press releases by leading consumer packaged goods brands, the authors examine the effect of the different types of CSR announcements on brand sales. The findings suggest that CSR initiatives that genuinely aim to reduce a brand's negative externalities (“corrective” and “compensating”) lift sales, whereas CSR actions focused on philanthropy (“cultivating goodwill”) can hurt sales. The authors propose two moderators—CSR reputation and CSR focus on environmental or social causes—and a mechanism for these effects, which they examine under controlled experimental settings. The experimental results show that, conditional on CSR reputation, consumers perceive varying degrees of sincerity in the different CSR types and that sincerity mediates the effect of CSR type on purchase intentions. Overall, the results suggest that consumers are more inclined to reward firms that directly reduce the negative by-products of their own business practices than to be impressed by public goodwill gestures. © American Marketing Association 2021.",

    "Abstract": "In response to a top ten global consumer trend, firms are increasingly introducing environmentally sustainable (\"green\") new products. Firms allocate significant resources to this area; thus, the authors consider the brand-level implications by investigating how the introduction of green new products changes attitude toward the brand. In examining this relationship, they draw from social identity and framing theories to investigate drivers of green new product introductions as well as the moderating effects of message framing, source credibility, and product type. Estimating a three-stage least squares model based on new product introductions from 75 brands across a four-year time period (2009-2012), the authors find that green new product introductions can indeed improve brand attitude and that both the brand and category's positioning influence the introduction of green new products. They also find that the quantity of green messages, the product type, and their source credibility influence the extent to which green new products change brand attitude. The authors use these findings to provide guidance for managers as they attempt to effectively link their green innovation efforts to improve consumer attitudes toward their brands. © 2014, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "While prior research has found that consumer-influenced production improves purchase intentions, the author proposes that it can counterintuitively backfire. This work demonstrates that when consumers have some control over production (e.g., ordering products on demand, customization, preordering), they have lower purchase intentions for products made with unethical processes (e.g., pollution, underpaid labor) than if they had no role in production (i.e., buying what is already in inventory). This effect reverses, however, with positive ethical production (e.g., recycled materials). Because consumers have direct responsibility for whether a product is made, feelings of anticipated guilt or gratification result depending on the ethicality of the production process. This work also proposes a novel threefold conceptualization of responsibility that can be used as managerial levers: direct responsibility, diffusion of responsibility, and broad responsibility. Field studies using Facebook’s advertising platform demonstrate positioning strategies for fair-trade brands and advocacy groups. © American Marketing Association 2019.",

    "Source title": "Industrial Marketing Management",
    "Method": "Field Survey",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "Scholars have recently argued that startups and incumbents play differential roles in the disruptive transformations of industries toward sustainability and that the transformations are only likely to succeed if both startups and incumbents contribute. To understand their respective contributions and, thus, to understand how industries make the transition toward sustainability, comparative studies of incumbents versus startups during this transformation have been identified as a central pursuit, but yet they are mostly lacking. Since business models have become a principal way of characterizing firms, the present study takes a business model perspective and derives business model archetypes in the electrical power sector from an analysis of 280 startups and incumbents in three different countries. The selected countries (USA, UK, and India) represent three different energy profiles and leading instances of disruption in the energy sector. The article, then, undertakes a comparative analysis of startups and incumbents based on the empirically distilled business model archetypes and develops propositions on startups, incumbents, and business models in industry transformations. This analysis produces several important insights. First, incumbents do not seem to engage in less business model experimentation than startups. Second, incumbents have adopted several new business models that are not pursued by startups. Third, startups have espoused some business models that are not pursued by incumbents. Fourth, foreign firms can also affect the ‘green’ transformation of an industry in a focal country. Finally, the identified business model archetypes are likely to be of interest to scholars and practitioners who are seeking an improved understanding of business models in the electrical power industry and the industry's competitive landscape. © 2021 The Author(s)",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Method": "Field Survey",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2016",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a better theoretical and empirical understanding of the causal and contextual mechanisms explaining the relationship between customer orientation and business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A three-stage least squares model was used on a sample of 3,720 French firms with 20 or more employees. Findings: By using a moderated mediation approach, it was found that the mediating effect of environmental customer innovation on the relationship between customer orientation and business performance under different contextual factors (market environment, firm size and sector of activity) can be significantly stronger or weaker. Research limitations/implications: This analysis is restricted by the choice of one particular country, and further research should use data from other countries to develop a general understanding of the issues examined. Additionally, examining relevant mechanisms other than firm performance measures will advance the understanding of the customer orientation–firm performance linkage. Because of the fact that the majority of variables used are binary and that each survey was conducted in a particular situation and in a particular context, the picture portrayed could be biased. Because environmental issues not only concern consumers but also all other market actors, it would be highly useful to verify the obtained results using broader concepts such as Hult’s (2011) “market orientation plus” concept or the “sustainable market orientation” developed by Mitchell et al. (2010). Practical implications: According to the results, to achieve market success and sustain a competitive advantage, managers must simultaneously invest in customer orientation and innovation performance. Additionally, managers should consider market environment, firm size and sector of activity as important contingencies in their decision of whether to invest in customer orientation. Originality/value: This study makes an important contribution by opening up a “black box” and offers a deeper perspective on how and why customer orientation affects firm performance. In particular, rather than providing separate analyses of mediating and moderating effects, this study proposes a simultaneous analysis that reveals how and under what conditions customer orientation improves business performance. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Past literature argued that the purchase of luxury goods is driven by people's motivation to conform or fit into our economic and social system. In this study, the authors focus on a new aspect of consumption, that is, renting instead of purchasing luxury goods, backed by the emerging opportunities of sharing economy platforms. Drawing upon the analysis of spontaneous consumers' online communications (in the form of tweets), this study aims to investigate the motivations to engage with luxury garment renting within a collaborative consumption context. To this end, a series of automatic content analyses, via two studies, were conducted using the tweets posted with respect to the Run the Runway collaborative consumption platform. Results demonstrate consumers' increased willingness to show their social status through renting rather than owning luxurious apparel based on five main motivators (need to wear new clothes for a special event, inspirations created by the products/brands, possibility to explore a new way of consuming luxury goods, need to make more sustainable choices, and to increase the life cycle of each luxury product). The implications of these findings are discussed, while they pave the way for future research in collaborative consumption of luxury retailing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "The increase in global temperatures requires substantial reductions in the greenhouse emissions from consumer choices. The authors use an experimental incentive-compatible online supermarket to analyze the effect of a carbon-based choice architecture, which presents commodities to customers in high, medium, and low carbon footprint groups, in reducing the carbon footprints of grocery baskets. The authors relate this choice architecture to two other policy interventions: (1) a bonus-malus carbon tax on all grocery products and (2) moral goal priming using an online banner noting the moral importance of reducing one’s carbon footprint. Participants shopped from their home in an online store containing 612 existing food products and 39 existing nonfood products for which the authors had carbon footprint data over three successive weeks, with the interventions occurring in the second and third weeks. Choice architecture reduced participants’ carbon footprint significantly in the third week by reducing the proportion of choices made in the high-carbon aisle. The carbon tax reduced carbon footprint in both weeks, primarily by reducing overall spend. The goal-priming banner led to a small reduction in carbon footprint in the second week only. Thus, the design of the marketplace plays an important role in achieving the policy objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. © The Author(s) 2021.",

    "Abstract": "With the assumption that the distinctive effect of provincial norms (versus general norms) derives from a spatial distance between the actors and reference groups, the present research examined whether the effect of two types of descriptive norms on consumers' sustainable behaviors can be moderated by construal-level messages. Both a laboratory (Study 1) and field experiment (Study 2) demonstrated that provincial norms (versus general norms) are more effective in encouraging consumers to participate in a sustainability campaign when paired with low-construal-level messages; but provincial norms are no longer superior to general norms when both norms are presented with high-construal-level messages. The findings collectively indicated that the congruence between types of descriptive norms and construal level messages leads to consumers' attitudinal and behavioral changes.

    "Year": "2018",
    "Abstract": "This research documents a systematic bias in memory for ethical attribute information: consumers have better memory for an ethical attribute when a product performs well on the attribute versus when a product performs poorly on the attribute. Because consumers want to avoid emotionally difficult ethical information (e.g., child labor) but believe they should remember it in order to do the right thing, the presence of negative ethical information in a choice or evaluation produces conflict between the want and should selves. Consumers resolve this conflict by letting the want self prevail and forgetting or misremembering the negative ethical information. A series of studies establishes the willfully ignorant memory effect, shows that it holds only for ethical attributes and not for other attributes, and provides process evidence that it is driven by consumers allowing the want self to prevail in order to avoid negative feelings associated with the conflict. We also ameliorate the effect by reducing the amount of pressure exerted by the should self. Lastly, we demonstrate that consumers judge forgetting negative ethical information as more morally acceptable than remembering but ignoring it, suggesting that willfully ignorant memory is a more morally acceptable form of coping with want/should conflict. © 2017 The Author.

The applicability of such goals to the positioning of environmental products is also tested. Design/methodology/approach – Study 1 used 62 laddering interviews to identify a hierarchical map of adoption related goals. Study 2 used a survey design (N = 152 students) to test the effects of construal-goal fit on evaluations of environmental product attributes of a hybrid car. Study 3 involved an online experiment (N = 125 consumer panellists) to test the effects of construal-goal fit on consumers’ willingness to pay a price premium (WTPP) for energy-efficient light bulbs. Findings – A hierarchical goal map displays consumption goals attainable through environmentally sustainable products. Consumers with a chronic, high-level construal placed more importance on product attributes associated with abstract goals than those with chronic, low-level construal. This effect was stronger for males than for females. Additionally, construal-goal fit increased WTPP. Research limitations/implications – The results suggest that marketers consider construal-goal fit to communicate the value of environmentally sustainable products. The results, however, should be replicated in other product categories and across diverse cultural settings.

Additionally, it tests the effects of construal-goal fit on evaluations of environmental products, providing insights for marketers seeking to improve their promotional efforts and for public policymakers as they institute demarketing campaigns. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "The consequences of overconsumption and the recent popularity of simple living point to consumer interest in reducing belongings. They also raise an interesting question-what is a useful approach to downsizing and decluttering? We investigate how dis/order (messy vs.Tidy items) affects downsizing and find, across nine focal studies, that (a) consumers retain fewer items when choosing from a disordered set because (b) order facilitates the comparisons within category that underlie the tendency to retain items. The impact of dis/order is altered by consumers' comparison tendencies, waste aversion, and decision strategy (selection vs. rejection), which serve as theoretically and pragmatically relevant moderators. Though consumers' lay beliefs favor rejecting from order (i.e., choosing what to get rid of from tidy items), our findings point to the usefulness of selecting from disorder (i.e., choosing what to keep from messy items) as a downsizing strategy. Together, this research has implications for consumer downsizing activities, the burgeoning home organization and storage industries, as well as sustainability. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

    "Abstract": "Recent marketing research has identified mixed effects of luxury companies’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement on customer-level outcomes. To gain a better understanding of these effects, we develop a conceptual framework in which we propose that, unless carefully implemented, CSR engagement leads to lower financial performance, decreased customer loyalty, and elevated extrinsic CSR attributions for luxury companies. These effects are exacerbated if consumers actively deliberate on the company’s CSR efforts. However, luxury companies can mitigate these pitfalls and reap the potential rewards of CSR engagement by (1) engaging in company-internal, especially employee-focused CSR instead of company-external, philanthropic CSR or (2) framing their brands as sustainable instead of exclusive. We find consistent support for our theorizing in five empirical studies. The results contribute to existing knowledge on stakeholder reactions to luxury brands’ CSR and can help managers successfully navigate the implementation of CSR in luxury contexts. © 2020, The Author(s).",

    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2020",
    "Abstract": "This article introduces the concept of conspicuous anticonsumption and provides evidence that it can be an effective means for green demarketing brands to encourage anticonsumption. Conspicuous anticonsumption refers to practices whereby brands provide visible signals imbued with meaning that consumers use to convey environmental motivations for consumption reduction activities. Two experiments suggest that without a signal, observers perceive anticonsumers to have lower socioeconomic status. However, when a visible signal communicates environmental motivations for anticonsumption actions, negative status inferences are mitigated and perceptions of the associated brand become more favorable. These visible signals confer status and restore the symbolic benefits that are often lost when consumption is forgone. Because symbolic benefits are powerful drivers of consumption choices, conspicuous anticonsumption can appeal to a broader base of moderate consumers. This practice has the potential to reduce negative environmental impact on a societal level as well as have positive outcomes for the brand. Counter to the prosocial perspective taken in most anticonsumption literature and activist thinking, This study highlights the importance of focusing on the personal symbolic benefits and costs of anticonsumption at the individual level. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

However, given emerging markets’ ever-changing dynamics, it is unclear whether transformative services suffice for such organizations to move towards economic and social sustainability. We present two studies undertaken in the context of missionary hospitals in India. Study 1 identifies that hospitals rely on innovations in transformative services, driven by the co-creation of knowledge by various stakeholders, to remain socially and economically sustainable. Study 2 develops and tests hypotheses using data from 183 hospitals, showing that employee voice, community engagement, and diversity of organizational expertise increase innovation in transformative services at a decreasing rate, while resource munificence and commercialization emphasis moderate the antecedents’ effects. Post hoc analyses show that innovation in transformative services positively affect economic and social sustainability, and that awareness creating efforts moderate these relationships. More broadly, innovations in transformative services are critical for emerging markets’ resource-poor organizations’ economic and social sustainability. © 2023, Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Abstract": "Nontraditional supply chain stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), may be able to affect the adoption of CSR practices in supply chains. However, little is known about how companies cooperate with international NGOs to handle supplier assessment. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling, we establish a parsimonious model that links cooperation with international NGOs to supplier assessment through three CSR dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Data collected from eight thousand SMEs in the transportation industry generally support the hypotheses. Moreover, our findings reveal that SMEs' size matters in the relationships between cooperation with international NGOs, CSR practices, and supplier assessment. Overall, this paper provides unique insights into the role that SME CSR activities play in the relationship between cooperation with international NGOs and supplier assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Abstract": "Environmental sustainability is a common practice of global brands, with 90% of the top 100 Interbrand global brands making statements about environmental efforts on their websites. In this research, the authors explore how a consumer’s global–local identity can affect consumer engagement with a global brand’s environmental sustainability initiative. Specifically, they examine consumer engagement in response to environmental messaging based on regulatory focus, spatial construal, and temporal construal. They theorize and find, across six experimental studies, that consumers with a strong global identity are more engaged with environmental sustainability initiatives when messaging includes frames congruent with their global identity, specifically promotion frames coupled with distant spatial frames and with proximal temporal frames. For consumers with a local identity, these regulatory and construal messaging frames do not impact consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives. Consumer environmental mindset mediates the effect of global–local identity on consumer engagement with environmental sustainability initiatives when such congruent frames are used, and consumer eagerness to act provides additional process explanation for the asymmetric spatial (distant) and temporal (proximal) construal effects. The findings have significant implications for the design of global brand and environmental policy messaging, particularly for consumers with a strong global identity. © American Marketing Association 2022.",

    "Abstract": "What would make the “elusive” green consumer actually choose sustainable products? This research draws from “dopamine hypothesis of reward” to demonstrate that physical activity/exercise (regular and immediate) is a vital factor in determining consumers' sustainable behaviors. More specifically, it examines the role of physical activity/exercise on sustainable consumption behaviors as well as the role of emotional intelligence and sustainability claims. Five studies were conducted to test the hypothesized relationships. The findings from Study 1a and 1b establish direct causal link between physical activity/exercise and customers' sustainable consumption behaviors. Studies 2a and 2b show that emotional intelligence (trait-based and ability-based) may explain the effect of physical activity/exercise (regular and immediate) on sustainable consumption behaviors. Finally, the findings from Study 3 demonstrate that sustainability claims moderate the effect of emotional intelligence on sustainable consumption behaviors. These findings offer significant implications for retailers and marketers to use physical activity/exercise as a strategic intervention to positively influence consumers' evaluation and behaviors toward sustainable products. © 2022 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "Some companies design processed foods to contain aesthetic imperfections such as non-uniformities in shape, color, or texture. Simultaneously, consumers annually discard millions of pounds of unprocessed, safe-to-eat fruits and vegetables owing to aesthetic imperfections. Why design processed foods with aesthetic imperfections when people discard unprocessed foods because of them? Seven studies, including a choice study at a grocery store and an incentive-compatible study, show that the effect of aesthetic imperfections on consumer preferences depends on whether foods are unprocessed or processed. While imperfections negatively influence preferences for unprocessed foods, they positively influence preferences for processed foods. We attribute this preference shift to consumers making opposing inferences about the human care involved in producing aesthetically imperfect processed and unprocessed foods. Building on research highlighting the positive effects of human presence in production, we thus show that perceived care drives food choice. We discuss implications for product design, retail promotion, and sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This research examines how warmth and competence advertising can be effectively utilized in luxury and sustainable brand advertising. Across four experimental studies, this research shows diametrically opposite “match-up” effects between advertising appeals and construal levels for luxury and sustainable brands. For a luxury brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a warmth (competence) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. In contrast, for a sustainable brand, consumers show favorable evaluations when a competence (warmth) appeal is combined with a high (low) construal level. Further, these match-up effects are mediated by two distinct mechanisms: brand admiration (a high construal level) and processing fluency (a low construal level). Theoretical and managerial implications from these findings are discussed. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising.",

    "Abstract": "This article proposes a utilitarian model in which recycling could reduce consumers' negative emotions from wasting resources (i.e., taking more resources than what is being consumed) and increase consumers' positive emotions from disposing of consumed resources. The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy perspective, this research argues for a better understanding of consumers' disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of environmental policies and campaigns. © 2017, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Across varying marketplace contexts (e.g., grocery stores, restaurants, e-commerce) managers display products with and without packaging, seemingly arbitrarily. Does displaying a product packaged as opposed to unpackaged influence consumers’ product responses? Six controlled experiments and an Instagram study address this question. We focus primarily on food products but show our results extend to non-food products that are natural (i.e., originate from plants, animals, or humans). We propose that, in addition to its physical function, packaging acts as a symbolic barrier that separates the product from nature, decreasing perceived product naturalness and leading to less favorable product responses. Consistent with our theorizing, the negative effects of packaging attenuate when product information or retail signage highlights the product’s connection to nature and are contingent on the importance of product naturalness. Our findings have implications for strategic use of packaging in physical and digital merchandising and sustainability initiatives aimed at reducing packaging. © 2021, Academy of Marketing Science.",

    "Abstract": "It has been known for some time that consumers' identities influence purchasing decisions and people form strong identity connections, or \"links,\" with products and brands. However, research has yet to determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at disposal in comparison to products that are not identity linked. Across seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer's identity, it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further, the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by consumers' motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the self because it is viewed as an identity threat. In sum, consumers will be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product is linked to a consumer's identity. This occurs because placing an identitylinked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid. © The Author 2016.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "In many situations, consumers use green products without a deliberate choice to use or purchase the product. This research explores how using a green product (e.g., a pair of headphones made from recycled materials) influences the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience (e.g., listening to music), even if consumers have not deliberately chosen or purchased the product. Five experiments in actual consumption settings revealed that using a green (vs. conventional) product enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience, referred to as the greenconsumption effect. Merely using a green product makes consumers perceive an increase in the extent to which they are valued as individuals by society, which leads to warm glow feelings, and consequently enhances the enjoyment of the accompanying consumption experience. When consumers experience low social worth, the positive effect of using green products on the accompanying consumption experience is amplified. The greenconsumption effect disappears when the negative environmental impact of the green product attribute is low. From a managerial standpoint, the current research identifies instances where brands can benefit from going green and encourages marketers, especially service providers, to promote green products that are instrumental in consumption experiences. © 2020 Oxford University Press.

Results support these predictions with consumers lower in elaboration more likely to choose an energy efficient product when perceived distance is proximal versus distal, while the distance effect has less of an influence on consumers prone to higher elaboration. We test the effect of distance perceptions within a retail lab environment, as well as across ad and retail contexts.

    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2022",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Consumers seldom consider end-use consumption (reuse or upcycling) when products reach the end of their lifecycle. This study shows that end-use consumption can be encouraged if individuals are primed to think creatively, engage in end-use ideation (imagine end-use) and become inspired by more original ideas. Design/methodology/approach: Three studies were carried out. Study 1 tested if creativity priming resulted in more effective end-use ideation (greater number of ideas and more original ideas) compared to environmental appeals and no intervention. Study 2 tested the effectiveness of creativity priming in a longitudinal setting. Study 3 demonstrated how creativity priming and end-use ideation could be practically executed using product packaging. Findings: Creativity priming represents an effective intervention to stimulate end-use consumption with particularly positive results amongst less creative consumers. However, it was not the number of generated ideas, but their originality during end-use ideation that triggered inspiration. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates which interventions are more effective in changing consumer behaviour in favour of more sustainable practices. Practical implications: Increasing environmental degradation requires consumers to change their behaviour by re-consuming products. This study shows that consumers can adopt end-use if they are primed to think creatively, imagine end-use consumption and generate more original ideas. Originality/value: Creative thinking has been leveraged at product development stages, but not at the end of products’ lifecycle. This study integrated creativity priming, consumer imagination and inspiration theories to explain the underlying mechanism behind end-use consumption to scale up its adoption by consumers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Year": "2024",
    "Abstract": "Psychological ownership has been linked to various environmental behaviors, but extant research has typically examined a specific environmental element (i.e., a lake or national park) instead of abstract entities as the target of this ownership. The current research investigates how psychological ownership of an abstract entity, namely one's community, impacts environmental attitudes and behaviors. Intrigued by previous research showing that consumer concern for the environment does not necessarily translate into pro-environmental action, we examine the connection between psychological ownership, environmental concern, and environmental behaviors. We propose and find that the perception of environmental ineffectiveness moderates how these variables relate to one another. Counterintuitively, higher levels of perceived environmental ineffectiveness (rather than effectiveness) strengthen the relationships between these variables. We draw on the theory of ritualistic behaviors to explain this phenomenon. Results from three studies using diverse respondents and data gathering approaches reveal a consistent pattern of relationships. Our research makes several important contributions. First, it identifies a quasi-endowment effect that extends from psychological ownership of community to environmental concern, which subsequently results in the protection of the environment through engagement in environmental behaviors. Second, this research extends the burgeoning psychological literature on rituals to the domain of environmental behaviors. Finally, using the conceptualization of environmental behavior as a ritual, this is the first study to illustrate how perceived consumer ineffectiveness moderates the effect of psychological ownership on environmental behaviors through environmental concern. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Year": "2010",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a framework for understanding consumer responses to ecolabelling. Design/methodology/approach: From a consumer perspective, ecolabels are tools for supporting decision making with regard to environmentally significant products. The paper proposes an adoption of innovation framework for understanding consumer responses. The framework is applied in a mall-intercept survey of the early adoption of a new ecolabel, the MSC label for sustainable fishery, in Denmark. Findings: Early adopters of a new ecolabel mostly employ a high effort adoption process. Starting the adoption process depends on both motivation (intention to buy sustainable fish products) and ability (issue-relevant knowledge). Whether and how quickly the consumer completes the adoption depends on his or her motivation, past experience with using ecolabels, and trust in the endorsing organisation. Research limitations/implications: Environmental and product-related factors did not differ between respondents. Hence, a complete account of the importance of these factors for the adoption and (especially) diffusion of the label is not provided. Practical implications: Consumers scoring highly on both issue-relevant knowledge and motivation are the most likely innovators and early adopters. Their high level of expertise means that they do not need a lot of explanation for understanding the label and its self-relevance and their strong motivation means that they will search for more if they need it (and if it is not too difficult to get). Originality/value: The paper makes both a conceptual and an empirical contribution, which are of value both to practitioners (ecolabel promoters and users) and to research on ecolabel effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "Given that overconsumption in industrial countries is a main cause of environmental degradation, a shift toward more sustainable consumption patterns is required. This study attempts to uncover personal and contextual barriers to consumers' purchases of green food and to strengthen knowledge about fostering green purchases. Survey data are used to examine the influence of distinct categories of personal factors (such as attitudes, personal norms, perceived behavior barriers, knowledge) and contextual factors (such as socioeconomic characteristics, living conditions, and store characteristics) on green purchases of Swiss consumers. Results from regression analysis suggest that green food purchases are facilitated by positive attitudes of consumers toward (a) environmental protection, (b) fair trade, (c) local products, and (d) availability of action-related knowledge. In turn, green behavior is negatively associated with (e) perceived time barriers and (f) frequency of shopping in supermarkets. Surprisingly, green purchases are not significantly related to moral thinking, monetary barriers, or the socioeconomic characteristics of the consumers. Implications for policy makers and for companies and marketers engaged in the promotion and commercialization of green products are discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Abstract": "More firms are adopting “green packaging” due to regulatory and environmental concerns. The alcoholic beverage industry has recently joined the lobby and major producers have introduced creative paper bottles for their alcoholic drinks. Previous research on sustainable labeling (e.g., eco-friendly labels) has shown the positive halo effect where sustainable labeling induces positive evaluations. In contrast, our research aims to reveal the negative halo effects of sustainable packaging in the case of paper-bottled alcoholic beverages. Across three studies, we explore consumers' perceptions toward alcoholic drinks packed in innovative paper bottles. Studies 1–2 demonstrate that consumers hold inferior expectations (i.e., sensory attributes, price, and purchase likelihood) toward alcoholic beverages packed in paper bottles. Study 3 demonstrates that the enforced messaging and attractive packaging can mitigate the negative halo effect for self-consumption and gifting. These findings contribute to the literature on sustainable packaging, especially in the novel space of paper-bottled alcoholic drinks. © 2023 The Authors.

    "Abstract": "A circular economy is a “closed-loop” system designed so that products flow back into the production cycle after use. With many companies implementing take-back programs as part of their sustainability strategy, a fundamental shift in consumption has occurred, with consumers considering disposal during and even before purchase decision making. Eight experiments reveal that consumers indicate a greater willingness to pay for circular program products. An increase in psychological ownership underlies the difference in product valuation. Specifically, the additional disposal control uniquely afforded by circular products increases the capacity of circular take-back program products to evoke psychological ownership. The process explanation is directly tested through mediation. Experimentally manipulating antecedents of psychological ownership (i.e., disposal control and psychological ownership) provides further support for the conceptual framework. © American Marketing Association 2023.",

    "Method": "Survey",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2011",
    "Abstract": "During the past 35 years, academic researchers have been examining the relationship between environmentally responsible consumption behavior and numerous antecedent variables. Because sustainability requires a long-term perspective, the study included generativity, a construct developed by Erikson (1950) and self-enhancement values (Schwartz, 1994) as antecedent variables for environmentally responsible consumption behavior. Generativity refers to individuals' beliefs that their current behavior has consequences that extend into future generations, while self-enhancement refers to values relating to power, wealth, and influence. These variables are related in that generativity requires consideration of others while self-enhancement generally refers to considering only one's self. This suggests that individuals high on generativity ought to be more aware of and concerned about the environment and should modify their behavior accordingly, and those who are high on self-enhancement should be less concerned or willing to change behavior. The results of the study, including French and American respondents, indicate that individuals who score high on generativity are more likely to have eco-friendly intentions and more environmentally responsible consumption behaviors, but generativity interacts with self-enhancement, resulting in an interpretation that is different from that typically found in environmentally related studies. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

    "Year": "2021",
    "Abstract": "In an effort to combat food waste, many firms have introduced rescue-based foods (RBFs), which are made from ingredients that are safe to eat but would otherwise be wasted, often due to aesthetic issues or oversupply. Although the benefits of RBF are varied, some firms adopt strategies that highlight RBF’s waste-reduction benefits, such as reduced landfill use or lower environmental impact. This research posits that when firms adopt strategies that highlight associations between physical waste and RBF, those associations can generate negative mental imagery, which can trigger disgust and mitigate positive consumer attitudes toward RBF. When such associations are not present, demand is consistent with demand for conventional foods. The authors find support for the role of mental imagery in this demand mitigation process, with some promotional appeals stimulating thoughts of physical waste. Counterintuitively, this research reveals that when marketers adopt the common practice of using environmental benefit appeals that can trigger physical waste associations, such as the color green, consumer demand for RBF diminishes. Conversely, focusing on the societal benefits or limiting the number of cues available to create physical waste associations generates consumer demand for these foods on a level equivalent to that of conventional food. © American Marketing Association 2021.",

    "Abstract": "Resource depletion and environmental pollution concerns are forcing manufacturers to pay greater attention to environmental sustainability. This is especially so for business-to-business (B2B) manufacturing firms who intensively use natural resources in their operations and are blamed for observable impacts on the environment. Despite investments in environmental sustainability practices by B2B manufacturers, studies provide little explanation about the extent B2B manufacturers obtain a positive brand image and superior market performance through environmental sustainability. Furthermore, research has not identified organisational practices that strengthen the path from environmental sustainability to market performance. Drawing on signalling theory, the customer relationship management (CRM) literature, attitude theory, and data collected from B2B manufacturers and their customers, we show that environmental sustainability practices provide positive benefits to B2B manufacturers' brand image, which, in turn, impacts market performance. Further, effective CRM and working with business customers with positive environmental attitudes are essential boundary conditions that strengthen the path from environmental sustainability practices to market performance. © 2020",

    "Abstract": "One of the main challenges in social entrepreneurship is capturing stakeholder support-from consumers, to legislators, to volunteers, to many others. Identifying likely supporters is the first step to sustainable success, but a difficult one. This research examines whether personality influences a person's tendency to support innovative social entrepreneurial (SE) ventures. Here, the possible influence of the \"Big Five\" personality traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism [OCEAN]) is examined; however, in line with prior research, attention is focused on both openness (an OCEAN trait) and empathy (a non-OCEAN trait). Two types of SE ventures are considered: social innovations and technological innovations. Data from a survey evaluating six SE ventures (three social and three technological) reveal that participants' personality influences support; however, observed influence differs by type of venture-openness underlies support of technological innovations, and empathy underlies support of social innovations. Further process analysis demonstrates that this influence is not direct but rather is mediated by people's perceptions of how much change the venture will make. These results offer social entrepreneurs insights into who might be prone to support SE ventures and, more important, why. © 2012, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Researchers often measure consumers’ responsiveness to a certain attribute (e.g., how much consumers value sustainability in products or low prices). Traditionally, this has been done by using multi-item self-report scales. We propose the use of a rating-based conjoint design analyzed with structural equation modeling as an alternative. To illustrate the approach, we apply it to the measurement of eco-utility. In doing so, we evaluate three likely advantages of the conjoint-based approach relative to traditional self-reports: (a) reduced bias due to Acquiescence Response Style, (b) reduced bias due to socially desirable responding, and (c) enhanced ability to control for the effects of product attributes that may be confounded with the focal attribute (e.g., price may be confounded with sustainability). Our results provide preliminary support for each of the proposed advantages. We conclude with implications for measurement and discuss how the current approach offers new ideas on how to measure latent variables. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",

    "Abstract": "Consumers in today's world are confronted with the alarming consequences of unsustainable behavior such as pollution and resource degradation. In addition, they are facing increases in uncertainty due to external events such as economic crises and terror attacks. These two problems are central to consumers’ lives, occur on a global scale, and have significant impact on the world's political, economic, environmental, and social landscapes. Contributing to research on persuasion and pro-social behavior, we show in four studies, conducted online, in the lab, and in the field, that these two problems are interconnected. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrate that uncertainty leads to lower levels of sustainable behavior in comparison to certainty. Study 2 reveals in addition that this is due to the display of higher levels of temporal discounting under uncertainty (i.e., adopting a more immediate orientation). Finally, Studies 3 and 4 show that emphasizing the immediate benefits of sustainability during uncertainty reverses the negative effect and leads consumers to act more sustainably. Overall, these findings provide valuable implications for policy makers and responsible marketers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

Studies 1 and 2 show that consumers high (vs. low) in BAS (measured) react more favorably to conservation appeals featuring cuteness, an effect mediated by experienced feelings of tenderness. Study 3 replicates the effect usinga prime of approach motivation (BAS) to assess donation intentions. Study 4, a large-scale field experiment conducted over eight weeks at multiple locations, shows that people recycle more at bins featuring cute visuals with active (high-BAS) messages compared with bins featuring cute visuals with passive (low-BAS) messages.

    "Abstract": "Recycling campaigns abound, but do consumers think about what becomes of those recyclables? This research proposes that product transformation salience (thinking about recyclables turning into new products) increases recycling. The authors theorize that consumers are inspired by the transformation of recyclables into new products and that this inspiration motivates them to recycle. The authors demonstrate the effect of product transformation messages on recycling behavior using a recycling campaign (Study 1) and advertisements for products made from recycled plastic (Study 2). Study 3 demonstrates the mediating role of inspiration. Then, three field studies provide robust support for the transformation salience effect through click-through rates for recycling advertisements (Study 4), recycling rates during pre–football game tailgating (Study 5), and a reduction in the amount of recyclable materials incorrectly placed in the landfill bin by students in a university residence hall (Study 6). The authors discuss implications for the design of recycling campaigns and positioning of recycled products in the marketplace as well as theoretical contributions regarding the roles of transformation salience and inspiration in encouraging recycling and other sustainable behaviors. © American Marketing Association 2019.",

    "Abstract": "Previous research has found that people tend to avoid products or behaviors that are linked to dissociative reference groups. The present research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer)s group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not. They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together, the results highlight conditions under which communicating information about the behaviors of dissociative out-groups can be used to spur consumers to engage in positive actions. © 2014, American Marketing Association.",

    "Abstract": "Do true cost campaigns (TCCs)—which display prices at the point of purchase that include social and environmental negative externalities—nudge consumers toward more expensive sustainable products? From a theoretical point of view, the answer is promising: Communicating true costs means introducing external reference prices that provide a benchmark for consumers to assess price acceptability. Showing true costs triggers a general reference to the price of sustainability, and the higher price of sustainable products becomes at least partially explained by their lower “hidden costs” (i.e., costs to compensate for all environmental and social impacts). In two empirical studies, we demonstrate that for TCCs to be effective, the hidden costs for the sustainable products must be lower than those for the conventional alternatives. Interestingly, under this condition, TCCs have an effect in markets characterized by a larger (study 1) and a smaller (study 2) green gap. In both studies, we find that increased perceived price fairness explains the effect of TCCs, as measured by the relative preference for the sustainable compared to the conventional product. In addition, we see that the price difference between the two products plays a significant role in forming this preference judgment, independent of other factors included in the model and especially independent of TCC. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "Production waste, or inefficiencies in product manufacturing, is a major contributor to environmental problems. Consider production waste in garment manufacturing -which has been criticized for wasteful use of natural resources (e.g., using excessive water and fabric) and wasteful disposal of resource residuals (e.g., discarding excessive wastewater and fabric scraps). The present research examines consumer reactions to production waste and its mitigation as a function of whether it is characterized in terms of resource use versus disposal. A series of seven studies (including field and secondary data) finds that (i) consumers are less sensitive to wasteful resource use than disposal due to lower perceptions of environmental harm; (ii) likewise, consumers are less sensitive to waste mitigation targeting resource use than disposal due to lower perceptions of environmental benefit; and (iii) these waste reaction differences are attenuated when resource scarcity or long-term orientation is heightened (which increases consumer sensitivity to resource use). Together, this research sheds light on how, why, and when consumers are averse to production waste, while providing guidance regarding interventions focused on fighting production waste and promoting sustainability.  © The Author(s) 2023.",

This research takes a particular path to understanding environmental consumption- through a focus on temporal perspective. Evidence from six studies demonstrates the positive effect of a cyclical temporal perspective, versus a linear temporal perspective, on consumers' pro-environmental behavior. The research shows that individuals with a cyclical perspective are more likely to include the environment in the self, which leads to higher pro-environmental behavioral intentions and more pro-environmental behavior. This temporal perspective effect is attenuated for consumers already high on green values. The authors also examine a marketercontrolled moderator and show that consumers are more likely to purchase a pro-environmental product when they see a temporal-perspective-congruent promotional appeal. The research contributes to both the time perception and the environmental consumption literature and offers several practical implications for organizations to promote sustainable consumer behavior.  © The Author(s) 2023.",

    "Abstract": "Building on optimal distinctiveness theory, this research examines the effects of social class on green consumption. Across six studies, we find a curvilinear effect of social class on green consumption, with the middle class having greater propensity for green consumption compared to the lower and upper classes. This effect can be explained by tension between need for assimilation (NFA) and need for differentiation (NFD) that varies among the three social classes in establishing their optimally distinctive identities. The lower class has a dominant NFA, the upper class has a dominant NFD, and the middle class has dual motivation for assimilation and differentiation. Concomitantly, green consumption has the dual function of assimilation and differentiation. The middle class perceives green consumption as simultaneously assimilating and differentiating, which satisfies their dual motivation and enhances their propensity for green consumption. By contrast, the lower class perceives the differentiation function of green consumption as contradicting their dominant NFA, and the upper class perceives the assimilation function as contradicting their dominant NFD, which lower both their propensities for green consumption. Furthermore, these effects are moderated by consumers' power distance belief. These novel findings have significant theoretical and practical implications on building a more sustainable society. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

    "Abstract": "Building on prior work examining discrete emotions and consumer behavior, the present research proposes that consumers are more likely to engage in the target sustainable behavior when marketers use an emotional appeal that matches the brand’s expressed values or one that is congruent with consumers’ value priority. In particular, we focus on two contrasting positive emotions—pride and awe. We show that the effectiveness of pride and awe appeals depends on the corresponding human values. Specifically, pride increases sustainable behavior and intentions when the self-enhancement value is prioritized; and awe increases sustainable behavior and intentions when the self-transcendence value is prioritized. Importantly, this interaction can be explained by enhanced self-efficacy. We demonstrate these effects across six studies, including a field study. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of sustainable consumption, reconcile prior research, and provide practical guidance for marketers and policy-makers. © 2023, The Author(s).",

    "Abstract": "This research applies Cognitive Energetics Theory (CET) to explain when and why consumers engage in sustainable behavior. Across six studies, we find a positive interaction effect of arousal and openness-to-change on sustainable behaviors. In particular, openness-to-change (vs conservation) increases the likelihood of engaging in effortful sustainable behaviors in a high-arousal state rather than in a low-arousal state. Interestingly, our results reveal that this interactive effect is explained by the tendency of consumers to believe that the target sustainable behavior requires less effort, when they are in a high-arousal state and endorsing openness-to-change. Moreover, perceived effort is positively related to sustainable behavior for experienced consumers but negatively related to the behavior for less experienced consumers. In addition, the effect of value and arousal on perceived effort is stronger among less experienced consumers but attenuated among more experienced consumers. Thus, arousal can serve as a catalyst to enhance value-consistent sustainable behaviors and help the less experienced consumers form habits. These findings contribute to CET by highlighting the important roles that values and arousal play in the motivational forces that drive and restrain sustainable behaviors. The results improve our understanding of how to motivate value-consistent sustainable behaviors, with implications for both marketers and policy-makers. © 2022 The Authors",

    "Year": "2022",
    "Abstract": "Although the seriousness of environmental issues has prompted calls for more green concerns in B2B buying, research has not given the area the attention it deserves. Building on social cognitive theory, we examine the role of pro-environmental values in B2B green buying decisions, and the moderation effects of purchasing experience and environmental hostility. We test our theoretical model by using hierarchical linear modeling with data from a conjoint experiment consisting of 816 purchase assessments nested in 102 B2B purchasing managers. Our results indicate that B2B purchasing managers disengage their pro-environmental values in B2B green buying decisions when they have little purchasing experience and perceive the business environment as highly hostile. This study offers important managerial implications for B2B purchasing managers and business owners/entrepreneurs that pursue sustainable development of their organizations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",

    "Year": "2023",
    "Abstract": "Sustainable consumption helps solve today's critical environmental problems, but such behavior tends to be altruistic, mainly benefiting the environment and other people. Thus, understanding precursors that drive a consumer to engage in sustainable consumption is important for scholars and green product marketers. This study examines how perceived life control—a factor not directly related to environmental decisions—influences sustainable purchase. Data from two waves of the World Value Survey indicate that perceived life control is positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes (which is a precondition for sustainable purchases). Five subsequent studies consistently show that perceived life control increases purchase intention for green products, and this happens because consumers with greater life control believe their purchases will be more effective in solving environmental problems (i.e., outcome efficacy). We further reveal that framing the benefits of a green product as temporally present (vs. future) attenuates the observed effect. These findings suggest that the practice of sustainable consumption may be explained by perceived life control in individuals and provide insights for environmental communication regarding the alignment between sustainable product appeals and individual differences. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

    "Source title": "European Journal of Marketing",
    "Method": "Experiments",
    "Decision": "Yes",
    "Year": "2020",
    "Abstract": "Purpose: Drawing on the branded service encounters perspective, the purpose of this study is to investigate how frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors affect customers’ brand evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: The research conducted two experiments. The first experiment explored the effect of frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors on customers’ brand evaluations via corporate hypocrisy. The second experiment explored the moderation effect of employees’ prototypicality and the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR) among customers. Findings: Experiment 1 indicates that for firms with a green brand image, frontline employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors result in customers’ perception that the firm is hypocritical, thus reducing their brand evaluations. Experiment 2 shows that employee prototypicality and CSR importance to the customer enhance the negative impact of frontline employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors on customers’ brand evaluations through customers’ perception of corporate hypocrisy. Research limitations/implications: This study is one of the first efforts to explore how frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors affect customers’ responses. It helps understand the impact of frontline employees’ counter-productive sustainable behaviors on customers’ brand perception, as well as the relationship between CSR and employees. Practical implications: This study suggests that firms’ green brand image does not always lead to positive customer response. When frontline employees’ behaviors are inconsistent with firms’ green brand image, it can trigger customers’ perceptions of corporate hypocrisy and thus influence their brand evaluations. Therefore, firms should train frontline service employees to make their behaviors align with the firms’ green brand image. Originality/value: This study is one of the first efforts to explore how frontline service employees’ environmentally irresponsible behaviors affect customers’ responses. It helps understand the impact of frontline employees’ counter-productive sustainable behaviors on customers’ brand perception, as well as the relationship between CSR and employee. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",

    "Abstract": "As an important part of social innovation, green product innovation (GPI) is widely regarded as a beneficial strategy for firms to achieve sustainable success. While the way to effectively leverage GPI has not been fully invested. To address this lack, this study examines the antecedent role of inter-organizational control mechanism by investigating the nature of the interplay between formal control and social control in relation to green supply chain collaboration. In addition, we probe the impact of GPI on firm triple bottom line due to the inconsistent results in existing literature. Based on a sample of 239 senior managers and directors in the Chinese manufacturing industry, we test the hypotheses through moderated structural equations modelling. The results show that formal control and social control should be applied as complements in promoting GPI, while only working on Moreover, enhance the awareness and adoption of GPI stimulates better environmental performance and social performance as a result. The relationship between GPI and financial performance is mediated by both environmental and social performance. Our findings will help B2B participants understand the GPI and potential sustainable, social and economic outcomes, and support them formulate more effective control mechanism strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",
